The login of opc user worked fine and he could do sudo su to root but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t su to oracle. When he did it just came back to root shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>[root@xxx ~]# su - oracle

[root@xxx ~]#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>There was nothing relevant in /var/log/messages or /var/log/secure. I tried it for some other user and it worked fine. Then I suspected something with the profile of oracle user and voila ! The .bashrc looked like this&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Database performance degradation due to multipath issues</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2021/03/22/database-performance-degradation-due-to-multipath-issues/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:54:19 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2021/03/22/database-performance-degradation-due-to-multipath-issues/</guid><description>&lt;p>To put it in bit of an Indian context, database is not your daughter-in-law that you can blame it for every performance issue that occurs in the environment. But it does happen. Most of the time it is the database that is blamed for all such issues. Many times, the issues are in some other layer like OS, network or storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Faced this issue recently at one of the customer sites where performance in one of the databases went down suddenly. It was a 2 node RAC on 12.1.0.2 running on Linux 7 using some kind of Hitachi SSD storage array. There were no changes as per DBA, application, OS and storage teams. But something must have changed somewhere. Otherwise why would performance degrade just like that. I &amp;amp; my colleague checked some details and found that something happened in the morning a day before. Starting from that point in time, the execution time for all the commonly run queries shot up. Generally speaking, when all the queries are doing bad and you are sure that nothing has been changed on the database side, the reasons could be outside the database. But being a DBA, it is not easy to prove that. We took AWRs from good and bad times and the wait events section looked like this:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Garbled display while running FMW installer on Linux</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2017/11/18/garbled-display-while-running-fmw-installer-on-linux/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Nov 2017 16:26:02 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2017/11/18/garbled-display-while-running-fmw-installer-on-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>A colleague faced this while running FMW installer on a Linux machine.

Removing Linux involves just formatting/removing the partitions. Now to remove GRUB either do &lt;strong>fdisk /mbr&lt;/strong> from a Windows 98 bootable CD or do &lt;strong>fixmbr&lt;/strong> after booting into repair mode with Windows XP CD. But if you have none then to remove GRUB you will need some utility like &lt;a href="http://www.ambience.sk/fdisk-master-boot-record-windows-linux-lilo-fixmbr.php">this one&lt;/a> and if you reboot before doing that it might make GRUB unable to boot into Windows. It will get stuck at GRUB&amp;gt; prompt only. So there is an option: to manually boot the OS you want (ie Windows). A quick search gave link to &lt;a href="http://www.ntcompatible.com/How_to_remove_GRUB_loader_t28242.html#150012">this thread&lt;/a>. It involves few commands on the GRUB prompt:&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
