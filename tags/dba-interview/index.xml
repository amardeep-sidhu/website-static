The guy was a DBA with 2 years of experience and it was supposed to be a telephonic call. I checked out his CV and wrote down around 8 questions on a paper, just to make sure that i myself don&amp;rsquo;t get confused during the interviewÂ  ;) . So i called him in the evening and started with introduction and his present job profile. Then i started with the questions from the projects he had done. He was confident about the stuff he was handling and replied all the questions honestly, saying NO at points where he didn&amp;rsquo;t know or was not involved in something. One of such thing was testing the backups. He said there is no testing done as such.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
