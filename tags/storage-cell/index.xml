I was working on adding a new storage cell to the configuration. After creating griddisks on the new cell and updating cellip.ora on all the VMs, I noticed that none of the clusters was able to see the new griddisks. I checked the usual suspects like if asm_diskstring was set properly, private network subnet mask on new cell was same as the old ones. All looked good. I started searching about the issue and stumbled upon some references mentioning &lt;a href="https://mudasirhakakblog.wordpress.com/2019/03/01/asm-scoped-security/">ASM scoped security&lt;/a>. I checked on one of the existing cells and that actually was the issue. The existing nodes had it enabled while the new one hadn&amp;rsquo;t. Running this command on an existing cell&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ORA-56841: Master Diskmon cannot connect to a CELL</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2016/05/19/ora-56841-master-diskmon-cannot-connect-to-a-cell/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 May 2016 22:15:05 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2016/05/19/ora-56841-master-diskmon-cannot-connect-to-a-cell/</guid><description>&lt;p>Faced this error while querying v$asm_disk after adding new storage cell IPs to cellip.ora on DB nodes of an existing cluster on Exadata. Query ends withÂ &lt;em>ORA-03113 end-of-file on communication channel&lt;/em> and &lt;em>ORA-56841&lt;/em> is reported in &lt;em>$ORA_CRS_HOME/log/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->/diskmon/diskmon.log&lt;/em>. Reason in my case was that the new cell was using different subnet for IB. It was pingable from the db nodes but querying v$asm_disk wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. Changing the subnet for IB on new cell to the one on existing cells fixed the issue.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
