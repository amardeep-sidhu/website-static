There is a small bundle of utilities, called &lt;a href="http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/">Unxutils&lt;/a> which can make you feel at home in Windows too. These are the exe&amp;rsquo;s of all major commands in Unix like more, less, ls, grep etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use it just download the zip file from the link above, extract it to some folder and add the path of exe&amp;rsquo;s to your Windows PATH. Restart your machine and you are done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using NTLDR to boot Linux…</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/05/06/using-ntldr-to-boot-linux/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 May 2007 09:26:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/05/06/using-ntldr-to-boot-linux/</guid><description>&lt;p>Sometimes, while installing Linux, installing LILO/GRUB to MBR makes you run into loads of issues, one of the most popular being that after reboot you are not able to boot into either of the OS ;) There is a way to use NTLDR to boot Linux, this way the MBR remains untouched and if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to see the Linux option, what you need to do is, edit your boot.ini and your are done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Running Linux from inside Windows…</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/03/16/running-linux-from-inside-windows/</link><pubDate>Fri, 16 Mar 2007 00:44:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/03/16/running-linux-from-inside-windows/</guid><description>&lt;p>Running Linux from right inside Windows, just like a normal application !!!
