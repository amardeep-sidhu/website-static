The manual process is real cumbersome. Today I came across few plugins which help in almost automating the upgrade stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade/">Wordpress Automatic upgrade:&lt;/a> As per description this plugin first takes backup and then upgrades. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try this one, though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-instant-upgrade/">Instant Upgrade:&lt;/a> I upgraded one of my blog using this. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take care of backup but otherwise the upgrade was super smooth. Just few clicks and you are done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to WordPress 2.5</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/upgrading-to-wordpress-2-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2008 17:46:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/upgrading-to-wordpress-2-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just finished upgrading to Wordpress 2.5. Everything seems to be working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another issue I just came to know that wherever i am using &lt;a href="https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/03/syntax-highlighting-for-code-in-wordpress/">syntaxhighlighter&lt;/a> to format the code, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t display properly in Internet Explorer. May be something to do with the plugin. Will try to fix it. It works fine in Mozilla.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
