I checked and found that everything was fine with Firefox but in IE 6 it was not possible to post a comment. I was using &lt;a href="http://www.herod.net/dypm/" title="Visit plugin homepage">Did You Pass Math&lt;/a> plugin to stop comment spam and it had some problems in IE. I disabled it for the time being and installed &lt;a href="http://www.hybrid6.com/webgeek/plugins/wp-spamfree">WP-SpamFree&lt;/a>. Everything seems to be fine except that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow very small comments and i haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to figure out where that setting is ? (yea&amp;hellip;i am really poor with this web stuff :( ).&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
