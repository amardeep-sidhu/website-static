&lt;ul>
&lt;li>An existing DB node has crashed and is unrecoverable (due to some failure and non-availability of any backups. Though some of the things may need to be done even if the backups were available).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have an existing Exadata rack that is virtualized. Now there is a new DB node and the existing clusters need to be extended to include the VMs on this new node.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I recently faced the first scenario where a virtualized DB node crashed and wasn&amp;rsquo;t recoverable. A bare metal DB node restore is a relatively simple procedure where we just have to reimage the node, create the needed directories, users etc and add it to the RAC cluster. In case of virtualization, the creation of VMs is an additional step that needs to be done. That makes it slightly more complex.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OneCommand Step 1 error</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2017/04/10/onecommand-step-1-error/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2017 22:20:41 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2017/04/10/onecommand-step-1-error/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hit this silly issue while doing an Exadata deployment for a customer. Step 1 was giving the following error:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>ERROR: 192.168.99.102 configured on dm01celadm01.example.com as dm01dbadm02 does not match expected value dm01dbadm02.example.com&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to make sense of it for quite some time until a colleague pointed out that the reverse lookup entries should be done for FQDN only. As it is clear in the above message reverse lookup of the IP 192.168.99.102 returns dm01dbadm02 instead of dm01dbadm02.example.com. Fixing this in DNS resolved the issue.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
