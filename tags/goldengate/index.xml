So started looking around. If we look at the command it is running, it runs clsecho. This is simply a shell script which in turn calls $CRS_HOME/bin/clsecho.bin . In the script, it sets various environment variables and that is where the problem was.

It is very much possible but some kind of restrictions apply. First is that the Endian order of both the systems should be same and the second is the bit width has to be same. For example it is not possible to run GoldenGate on a 32 bit system to read from a database that runs on some 64 bit platform. Assuming that the environemnt satisfies the above two conditions; we can use the LOGSOURCE option of TRANSLOGOPTIONS to achieve this.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tuning GoldenGate Extract Pump performance</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2012/05/25/tuning-goldengate-extract-pump-performance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2012 20:38:18 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2012/05/25/tuning-goldengate-extract-pump-performance/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just a quick note/post about the significance of COMPRESS and TCPBUFSIZE parameter in performance of a GoldenGate Extract Pump process. COMPRESS helps in compressing the outgoing blocks hence helping in better utilization of the bandwidth from source to target. GG is going to uncompress the blocks before writing them to the remote trail file on the target. Compression ratios of 4:1 or better can be achieved. Of course, use of COMPRESS may result in increased CPU usage on both the sides.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OGG-01004 Aborted grouped transaction on &lt;table_name>‘, Database error 1403 ()</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2011/11/04/ogg-01004-aborted-grouped-transaction-on-database-error-1403/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Nov 2011 16:38:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2011/11/04/ogg-01004-aborted-grouped-transaction-on-database-error-1403/</guid><description>&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2011/11/04/expdp-not-consistent/">last post&lt;/a> was just like that. It was this GoldenGate issue that woke me up from the deep sleep to do a post after a long time :P .&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well it was a simple schema to schema replication setup using GoldenGate. We were using the SCN method (Metalink Doc ID 1276058.1 &amp;amp; 1347191.1) to do the intial load so that there is no overlvapping of transactions and the replicat runs with minimum issues. Even after following this method, the replicat was hitting&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
