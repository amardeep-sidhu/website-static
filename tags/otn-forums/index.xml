There are reasons that it takes time for the things to be smooth. Fine. But what drives me mad is the way Oracle handled this and now ? The font size and those bloody bullets on left side which tell you if you have read the post before ? Please let me know if someone can interpret what those bullets tell and can read the forum without doing Ctrl + in Mozilla/Chrome and suffering from reading everything in large font size in IE 6 ?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OTN forums – 2nd upgrade attempt</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/08/28/otn-forums-2nd-upgrade-attempt/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2008 07:28:39 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/08/28/otn-forums-2nd-upgrade-attempt/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, as everybody has seen, last week they have again upgraded the OTN forums. And sadly it has been handled in a very poor manner. End result is that it is running terribly slow and throwing some errors many times. In my office, i cant even open it properly may be its too heavy or some issue with the internet. Also there has been lots of hues and cries about the new point system and all. That in my opinion is fine except that speed at which forums are running should be fine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OTN forums under maintenance</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/08/10/otn-forums-under-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2008 07:58:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/08/10/otn-forums-under-maintenance/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was just wondering what kind of maintenance OTN forums are undergoing ? It is 2nd day today and still not available. I checked it yesterday morning and now today morning still under maintenance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is another new design on the way ? ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you say !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just noticed that there is &lt;a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/ann.jspa?annID=808">an announcement&lt;/a> about the maintenance in Community Feedback forum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Due to maintenance, forums.oracle.com will be in read-only mode between 6pm PT, Aug. 8 and 6pm PT, Aug 10. Search will still be available during that time.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OTN forums get a new look</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/29/otn-forums-get-a-new-look/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2008 20:25:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/29/otn-forums-get-a-new-look/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just had a glimpse. OTN forums has got a new look. A bunch of new features has also been added. Some of the new things i noticed are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>That simple editor is now rich text editor. Also supports emoticons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can add tags to a post and it displays the tag cloud (for all the posts) on right side.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A post can be marked as a question and then there will be some points system based on answers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That list of Top users doesn&amp;rsquo;t show those users n ACEs. It display a new list of people instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Report Abuse button has been added (with each reply).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>May be there are some other changes too. That is what i noticed in the very first look.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>High Availability – Live ;)</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/28/high-availability-live/</link><pubDate>Sat, 28 Jun 2008 08:15:21 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/28/high-availability-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just opened OTN forums and found:&lt;/p>

But its there only on Database forums page not on PL/SQL. It reads like:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Posters, please mind these common-sense rules when participating here:&lt;/em> &lt;em>- When asking a question, provide all the details that someone would need to answer it. Consulting documentation first is highly recommended. (See &lt;a href="http://blogs.oracle.com/shay/2007/03/02">http://blogs.oracle.com/shay/2007/03/02&lt;/a> for more hints.)&lt;/em>
&lt;em>- When answering a question, please be courteous; there are different levels of experience represented here. A poorly worded question is better ignored than flamed - or better yet, help the poster ask a better question.&lt;/em> &lt;em>Thanks for doing your part to make this community as valuable as possible for everyone!&lt;/em> &lt;em>- OTN&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
