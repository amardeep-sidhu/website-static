The only difference was that in new database few of the large tables were partitioned. So instead of partitioning it after the import, i thought about pre-creating the tables (with partitioning) and then run import with ignore=Y . Everything went fine. But later on the front end application gave some error and we came to know that default values for columns in some tables were not set. I did some googling and didn&amp;rsquo;t find much. Then i &lt;a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=25113">posted&lt;/a> the same to OTN forums and came to know that if the table pre-exists, import doesn&amp;rsquo;t take care of default values of columns. Metalink note &lt;a href="https://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/f?p=130:14:4379750739032245945::::p14_database_id,p14_docid,p14_show_header,p14_show_help,p14_black_frame,p14_font:NOT,224727.1,1,1,1,helvetica">224727.1&lt;/a> discusses this. So if you are pre-creating the tables and there are some default values for any columns, set it manually, don&amp;rsquo;t rely on import for this. Same is true for impdp as well.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
