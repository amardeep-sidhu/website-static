It is very much possible but some kind of restrictions apply. First is that the Endian order of both the systems should be same and the second is the bit width has to be same. For example it is not possible to run GoldenGate on a 32 bit system to read from a database that runs on some 64 bit platform. Assuming that the environemnt satisfies the above two conditions; we can use theÂ LOGSOURCE option of TRANSLOGOPTIONS to achieve this.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
