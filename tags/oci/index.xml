Extended memory VMs are meant to solve that problem. Such VMs are able to access cores and memory across a single physical socket and it allows them to go beyond the limits of standard shapes. There are no additional charges for using this specific feature. Customer is charged on the basis of total number of cores and total amount of memory used.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Canâ€™t su to oracle user</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2023/01/20/cant-su-to-oracle-user/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 16:55:50 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2023/01/20/cant-su-to-oracle-user/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, got this issue reported by a DBA that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to su to oracle user from root on a Oracle Base Database VM in OCI. The login of opc user worked fine and he could do sudo su to root but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t su to oracle. When he did it just came back to root shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>[root@xxx ~]# su - oracle
Last login: Fri Jan 12 10:20:38 UTC 2023
[root@xxx ~]#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>There was nothing relevant in /var/log/messages or /var/log/secure. I tried it for some other user and it worked fine. Then I suspected something with the profile of oracle user and voila ! The .bashrc looked like this&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
