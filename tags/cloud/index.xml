In this post I will talk about the second group i.e. Exadata platform based services in detail and explore the possible deployment scenarios. When it comes to Exadata based options, it get a little complex as there are multiple ways to do it. To reiterate, there are two ways the deployment can be done. One is in the public cloud and another one is the private cloud (Exadata Cloud@Customer aka ExaCC) where the hardware is deployed in the customer&amp;rsquo;s data center.

Great ! But then you login, and suddenly you are faced with a whole range of services that can feel a bit&amp;hellip;overwhelming. It&amp;rsquo;s not always obvious which one&amp;rsquo;s the right fit, especially for someone new to the OCI database landscape. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to start this series of posts where we will walk through all the options that OCI throws at us for deploying databases.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
