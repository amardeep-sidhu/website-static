He was talking about the techniques one can use to optimize badly performing SQLs. But there does exist the other side of this story i.e. throwing hardware at a performance problem to fix it. Of course, it works till a point only and it can&amp;rsquo;t solve every damn performance problem out there. But it is relatively easier to do (costs money, though) and depending upon where you are hosting your workloads, can be quicker too. You see CPU usage going up or users complaining, simple thing to do is to throw more cores at the database. If the system is CPU starved, it is going to give some temporary relief and you can control the situation. Same can be the case with the storage IOPS. In some extreme cases, you could even migrate the database to a more powerful hardware. With systems like Exadata being around which can make even a bad SQL do fairly well, this lever becomes even more powerful. But is it sustainable or is it the right way to deal with these kind of issues?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Delete Delete Faster Faster ;)</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2009/10/delete-delete-faster-faster/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2009 20:53:36 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2009/10/delete-delete-faster-faster/</guid><description>&lt;p>2-3 days ago, I came across a code, intended to make delete faster.

&lt;p>Then he took the code out of procedure and wrote it in DECLARE, BEGIN, END and after running it showed the correct count.

&lt;p>I’ve been working with regular expressions in PL/SQL a lot lately and the one tool that’s helped me more than any other is Regex Buddy (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;a href="http://www.regexbuddy.com/">http://www.regexbuddy.com/&lt;/a>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->). Yeah, it’s not free, but it was the best $40 I’ve spent. There are free options, like regex coach and a few free online options, but the problem is you have to find one that matches the Oracle specific Posix ERE format. Regex buddy even has a drop-down for Oracle syntax (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;a href="http://www.regexbuddy.com/oracle.html">http://www.regexbuddy.com/oracle.html&lt;/a>&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted -->). I have no affiliation with this tool whatsoever, just found it to be exceptionally useful.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Spool to a .xls (excel) file…</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/06/spool-to-a-xls-excel-file/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Jun 2007 00:14:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/06/spool-to-a-xls-excel-file/</guid><description>&lt;p>A small tip, I read on &lt;a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?messageID=1849526">OTN&lt;/a> about spooling to a .xls (excel) file:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It goes like this&lt;/p>

spool onspool c:\salgrade.xls
select * from salgrade;
spool offset markup html off
spool off[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>

we have many reports devised by our vendor still we need some that r not available.&lt;br>
so we wanted the data to be exported in xl wherein i could manipulate to data to our need.&lt;br>
abt this spooling thing. i have copied down ur script and want to test it… but how do i access the shell prompt(do not know unix either)&lt;br>
thanks for the help&lt;br>
extend it bit further for me please&lt;br>

It was about keeping history of the SQL commands in SQL Plus on Linux. It is almost very simple. Just need to download a small utility called rlwrap from &lt;a href="http://utopia.knoware.nl/%7Ehlub/rlwrap/">here&lt;/a>. Its a tar.gz file. Download it, un-tar using&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]
tar -xvf rlwrap-0.28.tar.gz
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It will create a directory with the same name. cd to the directory and run&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]
./configure
[/sourcecode]&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
