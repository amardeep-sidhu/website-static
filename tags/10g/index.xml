The size of the database was around 800 GB. The major applications connecting to the database were developed in Pro*C and Oracle Forms. The upgrade itself pretty smooth but there were few glitches around that needed to be handled. Just thought about documenting all the issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Few users in the database were assigned the CREATE SESSION privilege through a password protected role (That role was the default role for that user). 10.2.0.5 onwards, password protected roles can’t be set as default roles. The alternate is to either disable the password for the role or assign CREATE SESSION directly to the user, not through a role.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrade 10gR1 to 10gR2 – DBUA error</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/upgrade-10gr1-to-10gr2-dbua-error/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2008 22:53:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/upgrade-10gr1-to-10gr2-dbua-error/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I was upgrading 10gR1 to 10gR2 (10.2.0.1) on Linux x86. The upgrade went almost fine (except that I had to install one package and change few kernel parameters) but while running DBUA to upgrade databases, it gave an error:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]Could not get database version from the Oracle Server component. The CEP file rdbmsup.sql does not provide the version directive&lt;/p>
&lt;p>and&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Start of root element expected. Upgrade Configuration file
&amp;lsquo;C:\Oracle10g2\cfgtoollogs\dbua\test\upgrade5\upgrade.xml&amp;rsquo; is not a valid XML file.[/sourcecode]&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
