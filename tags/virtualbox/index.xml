Today when I tried to start VirtualBox it failed with this error message.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Failed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_LDR_MISMATCH_NATIVE)&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Most of the online forums were asking to reinstall VirtualBox to fix the issue. But &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21654596/suddenly-getting-failed-to-load-vmmr0-r0-verr-ldr-mismatch-native-in-virtual">one of the thread&lt;/a> mentioned that it was being caused by Windows Driver Verifier. I disabled it, restarted Windows and VirtualBox worked like a charm. Didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to do more research as i quickly wanted to test something. May be we can skip some particular stuff from Driver Verifier and VirutalBox can then work.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
