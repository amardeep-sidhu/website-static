This is a Thank you community post. There are so many experts posting on Oracle related forums, doing blog posts, sharing their scripts with everyone. All of you are doing a great job. I would like to mention three names especially:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://oracle-base.com/">Tim Hall&lt;/a> : Tim is a legend ! I don&amp;rsquo;t consider something a new feature until Tim writes about it :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/all-postings/">Jonathan Lewis&lt;/a> : I don&amp;rsquo;t think there is anyone on this planet who has even once worked on a performance problem and hasn&amp;rsquo;t gained something from the knowledge shared by him on forums or in one of the blog posts.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
