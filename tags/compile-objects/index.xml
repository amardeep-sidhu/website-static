Few tables in the database were altered and the dependent objects became invalid. But the attempts to compile the objects using utlrp.sql or manually were failing. In all the cases it was giving the same error:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>SQL&amp;gt; alter function SCOTT.SOME_FUNCTION compile;
alter function SCOTT.SOME_FUNCTION compile
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL level 1
ORA-01422: exact fetch returns more than requested number of rows
ORA-06512: at line 27
SQL&amp;gt;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>At first look it sounded like some issue with the dictionary as the error in case of every object (be it a view, function or package) was the same.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
