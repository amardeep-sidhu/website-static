In a nutshell the reviews not related to the original question will be ignored/deleted (not decided yet, as Tom said).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As other people said in the comments, personally I too like this idea very much. Earlier, many times, there were questions which started with someone asking about appropriate SGA size, then there were some other twists and discussions and then the thread ended in discussion about good or bad authors or something similar light years away from the original topic.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
