The size of the database was around 800 GB. The major applications connecting to the database were developed in Pro*C and Oracle Forms. The upgrade itself pretty smooth but there were few glitches around that needed to be handled. Just thought about documenting all the issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Few users in the database were assigned the CREATE SESSION privilege through a password protected role (That role was the default role for that user). 10.2.0.5 onwards, password protected roles canâ€™t be set as default roles. The alternate is to either disable the password for the role or assign CREATE SESSION directly to the user, not through a role.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
