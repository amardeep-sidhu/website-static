If the database is up, check the database target monitoring properties and verify that the Oracle Home value is correct.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>The 2nd line clearly tells the problem but since the Cluster Database status in EM was green, so it took me a while to figure it out. Issue turned out to be a missing / in the end of ORACLE_HOME specified in monitoring configuration of the cluster database. The DB home specified was /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.4/dbhome_1 instead of /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.4/dbhome_1 &lt;strong>/&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ORA-01671 while creating cascaded standby from standby using RMAN DUPLICATE</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2015/12/19/ora-01671-while-creating-cascaded-standby-from-standby-using-rman-duplicate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Dec 2015 20:50:17 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2015/12/19/ora-01671-while-creating-cascaded-standby-from-standby-using-rman-duplicate/</guid><description>&lt;p>On a T5 Super Cluster (running 11.2.0.3) I was creating a cascaded standby from an already functional standby using RMAN DUPLICATE and it errored out with&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A quick search reveals that it is bugÂ 11715084 that affects most of the 11.x versions except 11.2.0.4. There is a one off patch available for most of the versions or one can install the bundle patch that includes the fix for this patch. I applied BP26 and it worked fine after that.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
