Great ! But then you login, and suddenly you are faced with a whole range of services that can feel a bit&amp;hellip;overwhelming. It&amp;rsquo;s not always obvious which one&amp;rsquo;s the right fit, especially for someone new to the OCI database landscape. That&amp;rsquo;s why I wanted to start this series of posts where we will walk through all the options that OCI throws at us for deploying databases.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Can’t su to oracle user</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2023/01/20/cant-su-to-oracle-user/</link><pubDate>Fri, 20 Jan 2023 16:55:50 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2023/01/20/cant-su-to-oracle-user/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week, got this issue reported by a DBA that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to su to oracle user from root on a Oracle Base Database VM in OCI. The login of opc user worked fine and he could do sudo su to root but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t su to oracle. When he did it just came back to root shell.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre tabindex="0">&lt;code>[root@xxx ~]# su - oracle

[root@xxx ~]#
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;p>There was nothing relevant in /var/log/messages or /var/log/secure. I tried it for some other user and it worked fine. Then I suspected something with the profile of oracle user and voila ! The .bashrc looked like this&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Smokescreen detects traffic from an Exadata VM</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2022/03/21/smokescreen-detects-traffic-from-an-exadata-vm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2022 19:30:16 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2022/03/21/smokescreen-detects-traffic-from-an-exadata-vm/</guid><description>&lt;p>A customer who is using an Exadata X8M-2 with multiple VMs had Smokescreen deployed in their company recently and they reported an issue that one of the Smokescreen decoy servers in their DC was seeing traffic from one of the Exadata VMs on a certain port. That was rather confusing as that port was the database listener port on that VM and why would a VM with Oracle RAC deployed try to access any random IP on the listener port. Also it was happening only for this VM. Nothing for so many other VMs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oracle database 12c</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2013/06/27/oracle-database-12c/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Jun 2013 07:28:45 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2013/06/27/oracle-database-12c/</guid><description>&lt;p>So there is a new toy in the market for database geeks : Oracle has released database 12c. Every social platform is abuzz with the 12c activity. So thought that I should also complete the ritual &lt;img alt="Winking smile" loading="lazy" src="https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile.png">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In &lt;a href="http://blog.aristadba.com/?p=254">this post&lt;/a> Aman has already summed up many important links.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Maria Colgan has posted some useful links &lt;a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/optimizer/entry/oracle_database_12c_is_here">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And &lt;a href="http://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=202202:2:::::P2_SUCHWORT:migrate12c">here is a link&lt;/a> to a slidedeck about Upgrading and Migrating to 12c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Happy 12c’ing !&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A database – one tablespace &amp; one datafile</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/10/a-database-one-tablespace-one-datafile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2008 21:32:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/10/a-database-one-tablespace-one-datafile/</guid><description>&lt;p>author: Sidhu

&lt;p>Today I was checking OTN forums and came across &lt;a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=2578116">a thread&lt;/a>. OP&amp;rsquo;s concern was:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>One of the db i am supporting has about 3.3 Terabytes capacity and the application is using only 1 huge tablespace with one big file.&lt;/em> &lt;em>the system is linux 4 , 32 bit.&lt;/em>
&lt;em>oracle version is 10.2.0.4&lt;/em> &lt;em>Is there a limit of space for a tablespace when you consider insert/delete/query performance?&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrade 10gR1 to 10gR2 – DBUA error</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/27/upgrade-10gr1-to-10gr2-dbua-error/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2008 22:53:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/27/upgrade-10gr1-to-10gr2-dbua-error/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I was upgrading 10gR1 to 10gR2 (10.2.0.1) on Linux x86. The upgrade went almost fine (except that I had to install one package and change few kernel parameters) but while running DBUA to upgrade databases, it gave an error:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]Could not get database version from the Oracle Server component. The CEP file rdbmsup.sql does not provide the version directive&lt;/p>
