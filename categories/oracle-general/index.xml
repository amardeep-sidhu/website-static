And sadly it has been handled in a very poor manner. End result is that it is running terribly slow and throwing some errors many times. In my office, i cant even open it properly may be its too heavy or some issue with the internet. Also there has been lots of hues and cries about the new point system and all. That in my opinion is fine except that speed at which forums are running should be fine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OTN forums under maintenance</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/08/10/otn-forums-under-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Aug 2008 07:58:28 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/08/10/otn-forums-under-maintenance/</guid><description>&lt;p>I was just wondering what kind of maintenance OTN forums are undergoing ? It is 2nd day today and still not available. I checked it yesterday morning and now today morning still under maintenance.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Is another new design on the way ? ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What you say !&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Just noticed that there is &lt;a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/ann.jspa?annID=808">an announcement&lt;/a> about the maintenance in Community Feedback forum.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Due to maintenance, forums.oracle.com will be in read-only mode between 6pm PT, Aug. 8 and 6pm PT, Aug 10. Search will still be available during that time.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>OTN forums get a new look</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/29/otn-forums-get-a-new-look/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Jun 2008 20:25:25 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/29/otn-forums-get-a-new-look/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just had a glimpse. OTN forums has got a new look. A bunch of new features has also been added. Some of the new things i noticed are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>That simple editor is now rich text editor. Also supports emoticons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>You can add tags to a post and it displays the tag cloud (for all the posts) on right side.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A post can be marked as a question and then there will be some points system based on answers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>That list of Top users doesn&amp;rsquo;t show those users n ACEs. It display a new list of people instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Report Abuse button has been added (with each reply).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>May be there are some other changes too. That is what i noticed in the very first look.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A database – one tablespace &amp; one datafile</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/10/a-database-one-tablespace-one-datafile/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Jun 2008 21:32:24 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/06/10/a-database-one-tablespace-one-datafile/</guid><description>&lt;p>author: Sidhu

&lt;p>Today I was checking OTN forums and came across &lt;a href="http://forums.oracle.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=2578116">a thread&lt;/a>. OP&amp;rsquo;s concern was:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>One of the db i am supporting has about 3.3 Terabytes capacity and the application is using only 1 huge tablespace with one big file.&lt;/em> &lt;em>the system is linux 4 , 32 bit.&lt;/em>
&lt;em>oracle version is 10.2.0.4&lt;/em> &lt;em>Is there a limit of space for a tablespace when you consider insert/delete/query performance?&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Have you searched “%” in metalink ?</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/04/18/have-you-searched-in-metalink/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Apr 2008 20:43:33 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/04/18/have-you-searched-in-metalink/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I was searching for an error message in metalink and it was giving strange messages.

In a nutshell the reviews not related to the original question will be ignored/deleted (not decided yet, as Tom said).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As other people said in the comments, personally I too like this idea very much. Earlier, many times, there were questions which started with someone asking about appropriate SGA size, then there were some other twists and discussions and then the thread ended in discussion about good or bad authors or something similar light years away from the original topic.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Official Oracle wiki</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/10/15/official-oracle-wiki/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Oct 2007 21:12:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/10/15/official-oracle-wiki/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today I was checking &lt;a href="http://awads.net/wp">Eddie Awad&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a>.

Just writing my experience. Whenever I search something related to Oracle in Google there are few sites that are bound to come up in the very first results ( No surety about the relevance and completeness of the content, though). Today I was searching about scheduling new jobs in oracle and I was, sort of, surprised to see &lt;a href="http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;hs=JQ1&amp;amp;q=oracle+new+job&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;meta=">the results&lt;/a> [Though, I got from there, what I was looking for &amp;amp; I would like to say Thanks for that].

I, having just about 10 months of experience with DBA profile, had to cover, everything about Oracle starting from creating database and up to performance tuning :) Its really an interesting job if the audience is good. But not an easy game. You have to know everything and have to be ready to answer people&amp;rsquo;s queries (some stupid &amp;amp; dumb questions also :) I had to cover a total of about 350 slides in a day or less. So at times, really went fast and skipping some of things. It was a nice experience as a whole :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Oracle 11g…</title><link>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/08/13/oracle-11g/</link><pubDate>Mon, 13 Aug 2007 22:25:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://v2.amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/08/13/oracle-11g/</guid><description>&lt;p>The day when Oracle 11g was made available for download on OTN, there was sort of, flood of posts in the Oracle blogsphere.

&lt;p>One of my friend (He is working in a non-IT company) called me and asked how to burn a PC so that it no more works :) Why ? because the PC they are given is too slow &amp;amp; old and thats the only way they can get a new one. I thought for a while and 1 or 2 ideas came to my mind. But to dig into little more details I called my friend &lt;a href="http://rollercoasters-bunker.blogspot.com/">Vaibhav&lt;/a> ( The guy I call to &amp;ldquo;discuss&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;know more about&amp;rdquo; all the techie things) He gave some really nice ideas.
