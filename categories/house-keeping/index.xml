I checked and found that everything was fine with Firefox but in IE 6 it was not possible to post a comment. I was using &lt;a href="http://www.herod.net/dypm/" title="Visit plugin homepage">Did You Pass Math&lt;/a> plugin to stop comment spam and it had some problems in IE. I disabled it for the time being and installed &lt;a href="http://www.hybrid6.com/webgeek/plugins/wp-spamfree">WP-SpamFree&lt;/a>. Everything seems to be fine except that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow very small comments and i haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to figure out where that setting is ? (yea&amp;hellip;i am really poor with this web stuff :( ).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automating WordPress 2.5 upgrade</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/04/automating-wordpress-2-5-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2008 11:59:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/04/automating-wordpress-2-5-upgrade/</guid><description>&lt;p>I recently &lt;a href="https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/30/upgrading-to-wordpress-25/">upgraded&lt;/a> my blog to Wordpress 2.5. The manual process is real cumbersome. Today I came across few plugins which help in almost automating the upgrade stuff.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade/">Wordpress Automatic upgrade:&lt;/a> As per description this plugin first takes backup and then upgrades. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try this one, though.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-instant-upgrade/">Instant Upgrade:&lt;/a> I upgraded one of my blog using this. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take care of backup but otherwise the upgrade was super smooth. Just few clicks and you are done.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Upgrading to WordPress 2.5</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/upgrading-to-wordpress-2-5/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2008 17:46:14 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/upgrading-to-wordpress-2-5/</guid><description>&lt;p>Just finished upgrading to Wordpress 2.5. Everything seems to be working fine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another issue I just came to know that wherever i am using &lt;a href="https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/03/syntax-highlighting-for-code-in-wordpress/">syntaxhighlighter&lt;/a> to format the code, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t display properly in Internet Explorer. May be something to do with the plugin. Will try to fix it. It works fine in Mozilla.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Syntax highlighting for code in WordPress</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/syntax-highlighting-for-code-in-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2008 22:07:13 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/syntax-highlighting-for-code-in-wordpress/</guid><description>&lt;p>I came across &lt;a href="http://www.oraclerant.com/?p=26">a post&lt;/a> about syntax highlighting for code in Wordpress on &lt;a href="http://www.oraclerant.com">Thomas Roach&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a> who in turn saw it on &lt;a href="http://tylermuth.wordpress.com/">Tyler Muth&amp;rsquo;s blog.&lt;/a> There is a plugin called &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/">syntax highlighter&lt;/a> which does all the beauty. Use is very simple:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Download it from &lt;a href="http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/syntaxhighlighter.zip">here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Upload to your blog&amp;rsquo;s plugins folder and extract it over there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now (on Wordpress) go to Plugins page and activate the plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To use it wrap your code like&lt;/p>
