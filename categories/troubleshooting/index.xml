There was a total of 16 GB of RAM on the server and the usage was above 90%, constantly. One of the reasons behind high usage was increase in the SGA size. It was increased from 2.5 GB (in 9i) to around 5 GB (in 10g). Another major chunk was being eaten by OS buffer cache.

The size of the database was around 800 GB. The major applications connecting to the database were developed in Pro*C and Oracle Forms. The upgrade itself pretty smooth but there were few glitches around that needed to be handled. Just thought about documenting all the issues:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Few users in the database were assigned the CREATE SESSION privilege through a password protected role (That role was the default role for that user). 10.2.0.5 onwards, password protected roles can’t be set as default roles. The alternate is to either disable the password for the role or assign CREATE SESSION directly to the user, not through a role.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ORA-39083: Object type INDEX failed to create with error</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2010/12/04/ora-39083-object-type-index-failed-to-create-with-error/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Dec 2010 17:22:56 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2010/12/04/ora-39083-object-type-index-failed-to-create-with-error/</guid><description>&lt;p>Another let-us-help-Google post ;).&lt;/p>

With the hope that i would be able to explain it properly, the whole scenario is like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>User will log in to the application with his username (Lets say USER01) and password (basically every application user is a database user).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>He is provided with a screen where he can enter details about the job and the code behind the button calls a PL/SQL procedure in the main application schema (lets say APP1) which in turn uses DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB to schedule the new job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The ultimate task of the job is to move data from one table in the first database to a table in the second database using a DB Link.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>There is a VPD policy applied on all the application users to restrict the view of data. Policy function uses SYS_CONTEXT to fetch some information about the logged in user. The main application user APP1 is exempted from policy and can see the whole data.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Things seem to work fine till the schedule part. But when the job runs it hits &lt;em>&lt;strong>ORA-02070: database does not support operator SYS_CONTEXT in this context&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> as SYS_CONTEXT and DB link doesn&amp;rsquo;t go together.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Take care of a slash in a SQL script</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2009/06/14/take-care-of-a-slash-in-a-sql-script/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Jun 2009 17:31:49 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2009/06/14/take-care-of-a-slash-in-a-sql-script/</guid><description>&lt;p>Since long time i have almost been writing useless posts only.

ORA-06512: in &amp;ldquo;SYS.DBMS_AW_EXP&amp;rdquo;, line 270
ORA-06512: in line 1
EXP-00083: The previous problem occurred when calling SYS.DBMS_AW_EXP.schema_info_exp[/sourcecode]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I googled a bit and found that the problem is with applying some patchset. Then metalink confirmed the same. Somebody tried applying a patch to upgrade it to 9.2.0.5 but didn&amp;rsquo;t perform all the steps (missed post installation steps, to be precise). Metalink &lt;a href="https://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/f?p=130:14:3653505393918947609::::p14_database_id,p14_docid,p14_show_header,p14_show_help,p14_black_frame,p14_font:NOT,300849.1,1,1,1,helvetica">Note 300849.1&lt;/a> covers the issue and also gives the solution. In nutshell startup the database with &lt;strong>startup migrate&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>run catpatch.sql&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Missing grants</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/03/missing-grants/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Mar 2008 20:37:15 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/03/03/missing-grants/</guid><description>&lt;p>Today one of my colleague was working on a simple PL/SQL procedure. Based on some logic it was returning count(*) from all_tab_columns for few tables. It gave count incorrectly for one table out of around fifty in total. He just hard coded the table name and ran it but again it showed count as zero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then he took the code out of procedure and wrote it in DECLARE, BEGIN, END and after running it showed the correct count. But ran as database procedure it always shows incorrectly.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ORA-03113 Refresh of a mview in Oracle 10g</title><link>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/01/03/ora-03113-refresh-of-a-mview-in-oracle-10g/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Jan 2008 07:33:00 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/01/03/ora-03113-refresh-of-a-mview-in-oracle-10g/</guid><description>&lt;p>At my workplace we were facing a problem with refresh of a mview. Say it was created in schema of user1 but when I tried to refresh it from user2 it would give ORA-03113: end-of-file on communication channel. Then we raised a SR and have been following up with Oracle support for long but it was not getting anywhere. Yesterday that guy seemed to have reached some point. The mviews that we have created and are having problem with refresh are created on top of both local &amp;amp; remote objects and he said that up to 11gr2 there is no possibility of creating mviews on both local and remote objects. I did validate this thing. All the mviews failing to refresh are created on top of both local &amp;amp; remote objects. But again from the owner the refresh is fine but from another user it gives problem. By the way that guy hinted at &lt;a href="https://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/f?p=130:15:3284197721413823598::::p15_database_id,p15_docid,p15_show_header,p15_show_help,p15_black_frame,p15_font:BUG,4084125,1,1,1,helvetica">bug 4084125&lt;/a> and also suggested a work around. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried that yet. Will try and update about the results.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
