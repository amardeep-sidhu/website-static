[{"content":"So, you are looking to run a database on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), right ? Great ! But then you login, and suddenly you are faced with a whole range of services that can feel a bit\u0026hellip;overwhelming. It\u0026rsquo;s not always obvious which one\u0026rsquo;s the right fit, especially for someone new to the OCI database landscape. That\u0026rsquo;s why I wanted to start this series of posts where we will walk through all the options that OCI throws at us for deploying databases.\nOne simple option that you could pick for running your database workloads in OCI is going the IaaS route where you spin a compute instance, attach some storage and install the binaries similar to what we are used to do on-premises. But that is not where the real value of OCI is. PaaS services bring that real value where it takes away the provisioning \u0026amp; management complexity. You are provided a nice looking console where you select your options, click create and done ! The same thing and the future management can also be done via APIs and the IaC options like Terraform.\nOCI offers the widest range of options in its public cloud offering but there is a private cloud offering as well which is called Exadata Cloud@Customer (ExaCC). The hardware in this case is deployed in the customer\u0026rsquo;s data center behind the firewall. I will add additional notes if a deployment option is available with ExaCC as well.\nWe could group the different services in many ways but I will keep it simple. First group is where the service is not based on the Exadata platform. What that means is that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t use the Exadata hardware underneath. There is only one offering in this space which is called Base Database Service. We will discuss this service in this post. The Second group is where the services are based on the Exadata platform. This is the one which offers the widest range of choices. That will the topic for the next post. In this one, let\u0026rsquo;s talk about the Base Database Service:\nOracle Base Database Services makes use of OCI compute VMs. The CPUs types supported are Intel, AMD \u0026amp; Ampere. It uses OCI Block Storage for providing the persistent storage. The maximum storage capacity (for the database, recovery area is separate) is capped at 80 TB. The storage management is done by ASM in RAC configurations but there is an option (called Fast Provisioning) for single node configurations which can make use of LVM for the storage management. Note that it may come with some limitations. It supports both single node as well as RAC systems (max nodes limited to 2). In a single node scenario, you can have a shape as small as 1 OCPU but RAC ones need a minimum of 2 OCPUs per node. It allows you to increase/decrease OCPUs (via a change shape operation). The supported Database Editions range from Standard Edition to Enterprise Edition - Extreme Performance. Supported Database Versions range from 19c to 23ai. It supports both BYOL (Bring Your Own License) and Paid (paying for both the infra and the license) options. The typical use cases of this one would be the not so demanding Oracle Database workloads. It is a great service and provides very good performance but it is not Exadata. So there may be limits to the compute power and IOPS it can provide. It may work well for most of the small to somewhat medium size workloads.\nHere are some more details about the characteristics, which may help you decide if it could be a good fit for the workload you are looking at:\nFor AMD based shapes, the max number of OCPUs is 64 (per node). There is a 16 GB of memory per core, so the maximum memory per node can be 1024 GB. For Intel based shapes, the max number of OCPUs is 32 (per node). There is a 16 GB of memory per core, so the maximum memory per node can be 512 GB. Network bandwidth in both these options is 1 Gbps per OCPU with maximum being capped at 40 Gbps. Theoretical maximum IOPS for AMD based shapes is 640K and for Intel based shapes it is 512K. So, that\u0026rsquo;s some basic information about the Base Database Service in OCI. This of course is limited information and true at the time of writing this post. In the Cloud world, things change rapidly.

Oracle has added the cells to existing Rack and done the cabling but th.e cells are powered down. They just enabled ILOM access to first new cell node. How do I take it from here.\nDo I need to use OEDA to create xml files for new 4 cell nodes? How do I update the IP addresses of the Cells before adding them to the cluster? Do I need to run OEDA install.sh? If I do need OEDA, should I enter info about only new cells or do I need to enter entire rack (2DB + 9Cells + 4newCells)? Won’t it cause any issues if I run install.sh with all this info as the cluster is already configured. If you have any documents or a link that explains this procedure, that would be great.

You can enter 0 for number of DB nodes and 4 for number of storage nodes.\nYou will need to make these changes manually. install.sh will not be used here.\nYou don’t need to run install.sh for this.

First part is where you patch the RA library and Grid \u0026amp; DB homes. Second part includes compute node \u0026amp; storage cell image patch and patches for IB/RoCE switches. Second part is exactly similar to Exadata except that it is bit restricted in terms of image versions that you can use. Only the versions that are certified for ZDLRA can be used. Also the RA library version and the Exadata image version should be compatible with each other. So if you are planning to patch only one part; RA library or the image, make sure that both the components stay compatible. The MOS note that has all these details is 1927416.1. This note should be the first place to go when you are planning to patch a ZDLRA. The steps for upgrade/patch, image patching are given in MOS note 2028931.1. There is another note 2639262.1 that discusses some of the known issues that you may face while doing the patching. It is important to review all three notes before you plan to patch.\nThe RA library patching part can be considered of two different types. This is an important difference. Make sure that you follow the right set of commands. When you are jumping between major versions say going from 12.x to 19.x, it is called an upgrade and the commands are like racli upgrade appliance \u0026ndash;step=1. Fernando talks about this in detail in this post.\nOn the other hand, when you are not jumping between versions; say going from 19.x to 19.x only, it is called patching and the commands are like racli patch appliance \u0026ndash;step=1. Fernando has discussed this in detail in this post.\nThe Exadata bit (image \u0026amp; switches patching) of it is exactly the same as we do in Exadata. Fernando talks about this in this post.\nThe RA library patching bit is pretty much automated and works fine most of the time. If you hit an issue, you may find the solution/workaround documented in one of the MOS notes.\nHappy patching !\nComments Comment by Jamie on 2024-02-09 19:29:01 +0530 Hi Amardeep , Nice article . is it possible to have patching method for ZDLRA as ROLLING ?\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2021/03/12/zdlra-patching/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eTo be honest, Fernando Simon has already documented all the steps needed in ZDLRA patching .

Second part is exactly similar to Exadata except that it is bit restricted in terms of image versions that you can use. Only the versions that are certified for ZDLRA can be used. Also the RA library version and the Exadata image version should be compatible with each other. So if you are planning to patch only one part; RA library or the image, make sure that both the components stay compatible. The MOS note that has all these details is 1927416.1. This note should be the first place to go when you are planning to patch a ZDLRA. The steps for upgrade/patch, image patching are given in MOS note 2028931.1. There is another note 2639262.1 that discusses some of the known issues that you may face while doing the patching. It is important to review all three notes before you plan to patch.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"ZDLRA patching"},{"content":"Faced this while running installer for setting up a 2 node RAC setup (version 19.8) on an Oracle SuperCluster.

Of course, there is a lot more that is needed while executing the whole plan, but these are some of the basics:\nThe very first thing is capacity planning. Depending upon the number \u0026amp; sizes of the DBs that you plan to backup, you need to choose the required configuration. In most cases, an Oracle guy would be doing this for you but you should actively participate in the exercise by providing all the necessary information so that the calculations can be as accurate as possible. Another things that plays an important role in deciding the capacity needed is the retention period i.e. period for which you would like to keep the backups in RA. More the number of days, more is the space that you will need. Another important thing to consider is whether you are getting only one RA (for primary or standby site) or getting two of them i.e. one each for primary and standby site. Both scenarios need different type of configurations (including the bandwidth requirements between primary and standby sites) so it needs to be planned accordingly. One more aspect you need to consider is long term retention. It could be Oracle Cloud object storage or some tape solution. Once you have enabled DB backups to ZDLRA, you will need to stop all other backups. Plan that accordingly. Oracle provides way to run the legacy and ZDLRA backups together but that is for short duration i.e. when you are migrating from legacy backups to ZDLRA. That is not really a way to run 2 backup strategies together for long term.

Though some of the things may need to be done even if the backups were available). We have an existing Exadata rack that is virtualized. Now there is a new DB node and the existing clusters need to be extended to include the VMs on this new node. I recently faced the first scenario where a virtualized DB node crashed and wasn\u0026rsquo;t recoverable. A bare metal DB node restore is a relatively simple procedure where we just have to reimage the node, create the needed directories, users etc and add it to the RAC cluster. In case of virtualization, the creation of VMs is an additional step that needs to be done. That makes it slightly more complex.\nSo the scenario is that we have an Exadata quarter rack where DB node1 has issues and needs to be reimaged and reconfigured. There are multiple VMs (so RAC clusters) created. As one of the DB node has gone down, each RAC cluster is running with one less instance. This failed node will need to be cleaned up from the RAC configuration before adding it back. Here are the steps that we need to follow to restore it back:\nReimage the node using an ISO and make it ready for creation of User Domains (aka VMs) Create the required VMs Create the required users, setup ssh with other nodes Clear the failed node configuration from existing RAC clusters Add the newly created VMs back to the respective RAC clusters Now let\u0026rsquo;s discuss these steps in detail.\nReimage : The simplest way to reimage an Exadata node is to connect the ISO (We can download the ISO for the version we need from MOS note 888828.1) using ILOM, set the next boot device to CD-ROM, reboot/reset the node and let it boot from CD-ROM. Most of the installation part is automated and doesn\u0026rsquo;t ask any questions. Once it is done installing, ipconf starts in interactive mode and asks for all the information like Name servers, NTP servers, IP addresses and hostnames for various network interfaces etc. Once done, it will boot into the Linux partition. Since we need to virtualize the node, we need to switch it to OVS by running a script called /opt/oracle.SupportTools/switch_to_ovm.sh. It will reboot the node to OVS partition. Next step is to run reclaim /opt/opt/oracle.SupportTools/reclaim.sh -free -reclaim to reclaim the space used for bare metal partition. At this moment we are done with the reimaging part. To use ILOM in a browser and be able to access the console, we need a Java enabled Windows/Linux system. And if there is a firewall between that system and the server, this link lists the ports that need to be allowed in the firewall.\nVMs creation : Next step is the creation of VMs. We will use OneCommand to achieve this. In this case, we had the original XML file used for deployment. Now we need to edit that configuration and remove the existing node\u0026rsquo;s details from it. We can import the XML into OEDA, make the required changes and save the configuration files. This needs to be done carefully as a simple mistake like a duplicate IP may cause issues with the ASM/DBs running on the other node. Once this is done, we can download the OneCommand patch (MOS note 888828.1) and run the create VMs step of OneCommand. As we have only one node in the XML file, so it is not going to touch the existing configuration.\nCreate users : Now we need to create the users on the newly created VMs. OneCommand\u0026rsquo;s create users step can be used here. It will create users on all the VMs. There are some things that we need to do manually here. First thing is to remove binaries from Grid \u0026amp; DB home. As we are going to use addnode.sh to add new nodes to existing RAC clusters, so binaries are going to be copied from an existing node. Then we need to change ownership of Grid \u0026amp; DB home directory tree to oracle:oinstall. Also for each VM, we need to setup passwordless ssh with the respective other VM (\u0026amp; vice versa) that is going to be part of the cluster.\nClear failed node config : Next we need to clear the failed node\u0026rsquo;s configuration from each of the RAC clusters. That is pretty much the standard stuff we do in RAC.\nAdd the new nodes : This again is just the standard addnode stuff we do in RAC.\nI have used the terms VM and Node interchangeably here but the context should make it clear if I am referring to the physical node or a VM. There is another method to do this using OEDACLI and it is documented in Exadata documentation. That automates a lot of these things. Check this link for the details.\nComments Comment by Ayush on 2020-05-12 13:18:25 +0530 Thanks for sharing this.

Many folks assume there is some sort of RAID configured in the storage layer whereas there is nothing like that. I will try to explain some of the concepts in this post.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s take an example of an Exadata quarter rack that has 2 db and 3 storage nodes (node means a server here). Few things to note:\nThe space for binaries installation on db nodes comes from the local disks installed in db nodes (600GB * 4 (expandable to 8) configured in RAID5). In case you are using OVM, same disks are used for keeping configuration files, Virtual disks for VMs etc. All of the ASM space comes from storage cells. The minimum configuration is 3 storage cells. So let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand what makes a storage cell. There are 12 disks in each storage cell (latest X7 cells are coming with 10 TB disks). As I mentioned above that there are 3 storage cells in a minimum configuraiton. So we have a total of 36 disks. There is no RAID configured in the storage layer. All the redundancy is handled at ASM level. So to create a disk group:\nFirst of all cell disks are created on each storage cell. 1 physical disk makes 1 cell disk. So a quarter rack has 36 cell disks. To divide the space in various disk groups (by default only two disk groups are created : DATA \u0026amp; RECO; you can choose how much space to give to each of them) grid disks are created. grid disk is a partition on the cell disk. slice of a disk in other words. Slice from each cell disk must be part of both the disk groups. We can\u0026rsquo;t have something like say DATA has 18 disks out of 36 and the RECO has another 18. That is not supported. Let\u0026rsquo;s say you decide to allocate 5 TB to DATA grid disks and 4 TB to RECO grid disks (out of 10 TB on each disk, approx 9 TB is what you get as usable). So you will divide each cell disk into 2 parts - 5 TB and 4 TB and you would have 36 slices of 5 TB each and 36 slices of 4 TB each. DATA disk group will be created using the 36 5 TB slices where grid disks from each storage cell constitute one failgroup. Similarly RECO disk group will be created using the 36 4 TB slices. What we have discussed above is a quarter rack scenario with High Capacity (HC) disks. There can be somewhat different configurations too:\nInstead of HC disks, you can have the Extreme Flash (EF) configuration which uses flash cards in place of disks. Everything remains the same except the number. Instead of 12 HC disks there will be 8 flash cards. With X3 I think, Oracle introduced an eighth rack configuration. In an eighth rack configuration db nodes come with half the cores (of quarter rack db nodes) and storage cells come with 6 disks in each of the cell. So here you would have only 18 disks in total. Everything else works in the same way. Hope it clarified some of the doubts about grid disks.\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2019/02/18/understanding-grid-disks-in-exadata/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUse of Exadata storage cells seems to be a very poorly understood concept.

So that means something is wrong with the disk. Since it is an external redundancy diskgroup not much can be done until the disk becomes available.\nSpeaking to the storage team cleared the air. One that the disk had gone offline at storage level so that is why even dd was not able to read it. Two that all these disks were thin provisioned (over provisioning of the storage space to improve the utilization; similar to over provisioning of CPU cores in the Virtualization world) from the storage. This particular disk 27 was meant for some other purpose but got wrongly allocated to this diskgroup. The actual space available in the pool (of this disk) was less than what was needed. The moment disks were added to the diskgroup, the rebalance kicked in and ASM started writing data to the disk. Within few minutes space became full and the storage software took the disk offline. Since ASM couldn\u0026rsquo;t write to the disk, the diskgroup was dismounted.\nFortunately, in the same pool, there was another disk that was still unused. So the storage guy dropped that disk and it freed up some space in the pool. He brought this disk 27 online after that. Diskgroup got mounted and the rebalance kicked in again. Finally, we dropped this disk and the rebalance started again. Once the rebalance completed, disk was free to be taken offline.\nComments Comment by Neerav on 2017-11-04 08:52:43 +0530 Great blog sir – Neerav\nComment by sachin on 2017-11-04 10:50:01 +0530 Good one\nComment by Sidhu on 2017-11-06 17:20:46 +0530 Cheers !\nComment by Sidhu on 2017-11-06 17:20:55 +0530 Thank you !\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2017/11/03/ora-15040-ora-15042-with-external-redundancy-diskgroup/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eA colleague was working on an ASM issue (Standalone one, Version 11.2.0.3 on AIX) at one of the customer sites.

It was an Oracle EBS environment so the TNS_ADMIN was set to the standard $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin/*hostname* path (on both the nodes). On node1 there was no tnsnames.ora file in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin so it was connecting to the standby using the Apps tnsnames.ora which was having the correct entry for standby. On node2 there was a file called tnsnames.ora in $ORACLE_HOME/network/admin but it was not having any entry for standby. It was trying to connect using that file (the default tns path) and failing with ORA-12154. Once we removed that file, it started using the Apps tnsnames.ora and logs started shipping.\nComments Comment by Corlins on 2022-04-28 21:29:07 +0530 Found this post super helpful after spending 2 days troubleshooting standby tns issues in ebs environment.

We can look at the above trace file also for more detail.\nNow to why did this happen ?\nThe RECOC1 is a HIGH redundancy disk group which means that if we want to place Voting files there, it should have at least 5 failure groups. In this configuration there are only 3 cells and that doesn’t meet the minimum failure groups condition (1 cell = 1 failgroup in Exadata).\nNow to how did it happen ?\nThis one was an Exadata X3 half rack and we planned to deploy it (for testing purpose) as 2 quarter racks : 1st cluster with db1, db2 + cell1, cell2, cell3 and 2nd cluster with db3, db4 + cell4, cell5, cell6, cell7. All the disk groups to be in High redundancy.\nBefore a certain 12.x Exadata software version it was not even possible to have all disk groups in High redundancy in a quarter rack as to have Voting disk in a High redundancy disk group you need to have a minimum of 5 failure groups (as mentioned above). In a quarter rack you have only 3 fail groups. With a certain 12.x Exadata software version a new feature quorum disks was introduced which made is possible to have that configuration. Read this link for more details. Basically we take a slice of disk from each DB node and add it to the disk group where you want to have the Voting file. 3 cells + 2 disks from DB nodes makes it 5 so all is good.\nNow while starting with the deployment we noticed that db node1 was having some hardware issues. As we needed the machine for testing so we decided to build the first cluster with 1 db node only. So the final configuration of 1st cluster had 1 db node + 3 cells. We imported the XML back in OEDA, modified the cluster 1 configuration to 1 db node and generated the configuration files. That is where the problem started. The RECO disk group still was High redundancy but as we had only 1 db node at this stage so the configuration was not even a candidate for quorum disks. Hence the above error. Changing DBFS_DG to Normal redundancy fixed the issue as when DBFS_DG is Normal redundancy, OneCommand will place the Voting files there.\nIdeally it shouldn’t happened as OEDA shouldn’t allow a configuration that is not doable. The case here is that as originally the configuration was having 2 db nodes + 3 cells so High redundancy for all disk groups was allowed in OEDA. While modifying the configuration when one db node was removed from the cluster, OEDA probably didn\u0026rsquo;t run the redundancy check on disk groups and it allowed the go past that screen. If you try to create a new configuration with 1 db node + 3 cells, it will not allow you to choose High redundancy for all disk groups. DBFS will remain in Normal redundancy. You can\u0026rsquo;t change that.\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2017/04/28/failed-to-create-voting-files-on-disk-group-recoc1/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLong story short, faced this issue while running OneCommand for one Exadata system.

That wasn’t possible in this case. After little bit of googling I stumbled upon this post by Jeremy Schneider. His colleague solved this problem with a very simple and clever workaround. Before root.sh prepares to run srvctl start listener command, run the add VIP command from another Window . Additional network would have already got added when root.sh runs on the new node.\nTo be able to perform this trick, you have to have the hosts file updated with the new VIP name and IP and be ready with the command to add the VIP. While root.sh is running, it will show a message like “there is already an active cluster, restarting to join”, immediately start trying to run srvctl add vip command in another window. The moment CRS, comes up the command will succeed. Immediately after that root.sh is going to run srvctl start listener command, and this time it shouldn\u0026rsquo;t fail as the VIP is already added.\nAnother small mistake we made was not updating the cellip.ora on the new node before running root.sh. That caused the root.sh to fail as it couldn’t talk to ASM running on existing cell nodes.

We were a group of 4 people who were traveling from Delhi and we reached Hyderabad on Friday morning. Just wanted to keep a day for visiting Ramoji Film City and also wanted to avoid the rush that morning travel on the conference\u0026rsquo;s starting day brings. So after dropping the luggage at the hotel we hired a taxi and reached Ramoji Film City. It is a huge place and it is tiring to move around checking everything. But fortunately on that day the weather was very pleasant so moving around was good fun. We took a ride what they call as Space Walk and watched few sets where some movies were shot. Also they have a pretty good bird sanctuary over there where they have pretty good number of beautiful birds. Spending time there was nice and fun.\nBy 7 PM or so we were done with everything and started back to hotel. As it was dinner time already so we directly headed to Paradise and had some awesome Biryani.\nSaturday was the first day of the conference. We reached the venue by 8:30 AM and the registration was pretty quick. Before starting of the technical sessions at 10 AM, we had plenty of time to move around, meet folks especially who we know online but had never met in person. For me it was my chance to meet Tim Hall in person for the first time. Simply put Tim is brilliant. His website is an inspiration for many bloggers. It was great meeting Tim in person and striking few conversations about various technologies.\nAlso met Kamran for the first time in person. Been connected to him on social media for quite some time now. It was great catching up with you mate.\nHad last met Francisco in Sangam 10 and this year got a chance to meet him again. The second question (first was how is job ;) ) he asked me was \u0026ldquo;How is your blog going ?\u0026rdquo; So that calls for some focus on blogging again :)\nThen we selected the sessions we wanted to attend and moved to respective rooms. I attended most of the sessions around database technology. There was good variety of sessions but I noticed that Engineered Systems part was missing. There could have been some sessions on Exadata, Exalogic and Super Cluster. That would make an interesting topic and would pull good audience.\nStart of the second day looked little lazy but with time it caught up. There were some free time slots for me as not all sessions were of my interest. So got some time to chat around with folks there.\nIn the end there was an excellent motivational session by Dr Rajdeep Manwani that was enjoyed by everyone in the audience. The key take away was that you yourself have to do something about the things that you think need to be fixed. Blaming others for mess up in your life isn\u0026rsquo;t going to help.\nThat was the end of the second day and the conference. We met everyone around and decided to leave. Our 9 PM flight to Delhi was delayed by 4 hours and we had plenty of time to reach the airport. So once again we headed to Paradise for dinner. We were having dinner and Kamran and Markus also reached there for checking out some Biryani. Finished our dinner, said good bye to them and left for the airport. Flight was delayed little more and finally reached home at 4 AM next morning. Long day !\nRead Tim\u0026rsquo;s take on Day1 and Day2.\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2015/11/24/sangam-15/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThis was my 6th year at Sangam and as always was good fun.

It starts sounding even more difficult as a lot of people don’t have access to Exadata environments. So thought about writing a small post on the same.\nIt actually is not as difficult as it sounds. There are a lot of really good resources available from where you can learn about Exadata architecture and the things that work differently from any non-Exadata platform. You might be able to do lot more RnD if you have got access to an Exadata environment but don’t worry if you haven\u0026rsquo;t. Without that also there is a lot that you can explore. So here we go:\nI think the best reference that one can start with is Expert Oracle Exadata book by Tanel Poder, Kerry Osborne and Randy Johnson. As a traditional book covers the subject topic by topic from ground up so it makes a fun read. This book is also no different. It will teach you a lot. They are already working on the second edition. (See here). Next you can jump to whitepapers on Oracle website Exadata page, blog posts (keep an eye on OraNA.info) and whitepapers written by other folks. There is a lot of useful material out there. You just need to Google a bit. Exadata documentation (not public yet) should be your next stop if you have got access to it. Patch 10386736 on MOS if you have got the access. Try to attend an Oracle Users Group conference if there is one happening in your area. Most likely someone would be presenting on Exadata so you can use that opportunity to learn about it. Also you will get a chance to ask him questions. Lastly if you have an Exadata machine available do all the RnD you can. Happy New Year and Happy Learning !\nComments Comment by Aman\u0026hellip;. on 2015-01-02 15:24:47 +0530 The best way to learn Exadata is to purchase a Quarter Rack. There is nothing like a “hands-on” learning and as an added benefit, one would get access to Support as well so you can learn and ask your questions/doubts directly to support services 😉 . The only issue, a small only, is the price but then again, there is always a price for quality, isn’t it!!\nOkay, so on a serious note, besides the mentioned links, Oracle’s Learning Library(http://oracle.com/goto/oll) has a complete series for Flash based videos to explain various concepts of Exadata. That’s a very good and Free resource to learn Exadata. Also, Uwe Hesse has written some really good stuff to understand the concepts of Exadata on his blog http://uhesse.com .\nAnd last but certainly not the least, attending an Oracle Univ course for the same would give one access to machines to learn the things and play with the technology. Also, the same would make one eligible for the certification.\nAman….\nComment by joseph on 2015-02-02 10:36:29 +0530 the hurdle really is getting access on a exadata machine so you can learn first hand\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2015/01/02/want-to-learn-exadata/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eMany people have asked me this question that how they can learn Exadata ?

COMPRESS helps in compressing the outgoing blocks hence helping in better utilization of the bandwidth from source to target. GG is going to uncompress the blocks before writing them to the remote trail file on the target. Compression ratios of 4:1 or better can be achieved. Of course, use of COMPRESS may result in increased CPU usage on both the sides.\nTCPBUFSIZE controls the size of the TCP buffer socket that is going to be used by the Extract. If the bandwidth allows, it will be a good idea to send larger packets. So depending upon the available bandwidth one can experiment with the values of TCPBUFSIZE. At one of the client sites, I saw a great increase in the performance after setting TCPBUFSIZE. The trail file (10 MB size) that was taking almost a minute to transfer started getting through in few seconds after setting this parameter. Documentation ( http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E35209_01/doc.1121/e29399.pdf page 313) provides the method to calculate the optimum value for TCPBUFSIZE for your environment.\nWhile using TCPBUFSIZE value for TCPFLUSHBYTES (at least equal to the value of TCPBUFSIZE) also needs to be set. It is the buffer that collects the data that is going to be transferred to the target.\nThese parameters can be used like following:\nrmthost, mgrport, compress, tcpbufsize 10000, tcpflushbytes 10000 Also see the metalink note 1071892.1.\nComments Comment by Puja on 2012-05-25 22:09:05 +0530 Thanks!

This whitepaper on Oracle website explains this feature in detail. Also Uwe Hesse has an excellent how to use all this post on his blog. You can see the compression levels one can achive by making use of HCC. It is very simple to use feature but one needs to be aware of few things before using HCC extensively as otherwise all your storage calculations may go weird. Here are few of the things to keep in mind:\nHCC works with direct path loads only that includes: CTAS, running impdp with ACCESS_METHOD=DIRECT or direct path inserts. If you insert data using a normal insert, it will not be HCC compressed.\nIt is most suited for tables that aren\u0026rsquo;t going to be updated once loaded. There are some complications (next point) that arise if some DML is going to be run on HCC compressed data.\nAt block level HCC stores data as compression units. A compression unit can be defined as a set of blocks. Now if some rows (stored with HCC) are updated, they need to be decompressed first. Also in that case the database needs to read the compression unit, not a single block. So once you do some update on the data stored in HCC, it will be moved out of HCC compression. To HCC compress it again you will need to do alter table table_name move compress for(Also see Metalink note 1332853.1) . So if the tables you are planning to use HCC upon, undergo frequent DML, HCC may not be best suited for that scenario. Not only it will add the additional overhead of running alter table move statement every time some updates happen, it may screw up the storage space calculations as well.\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2011/12/22/dml-and-hcc-exadata/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eHybrid Columnar Compression (HCC) is a new awesome feature in Exadata that helps in saving a lot of storage space in your environment. \u003ca href=\"http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/bi-foundation/ehcc-twp-131254.pdf\"\u003eThis whitepaper\u003c/a\u003e on Oracle website explains this feature in detail.

So these weird errors left us totally confused. Some guys suggested that expdp was not taking a consistent image and some transactions were getting overlapped (picked up by both expdp \u0026amp; GG extract trail). We took the database down and repeated the exercise but oops ! it hit almost the same errors again. So it was not about consistency for sure.\nTill now we haven\u0026rsquo;t been examining the contents of discard file very seriously. As the errors were pretty simple so we always suspected that some transactions were getting overlapped. Now it was high time to take some help from discard file as well ;) . We took the before/after image of the record from the discard file and checked it in the target database \u0026amp; values in one or two columns were different (that is why GG couldn\u0026rsquo;t find that record). The new values were the actual hint towards the solution [It was a table storing the mail requests and their statuses. This update that GG was trying to run was updating the status from NOT-SENT TO SENT but here on the target the status was already set to \u0026lsquo;ORA-something\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo;]. We got the clue that something must have run on the target itself that spoiled this record and now GG is not able to find it and abending with 1403. select * from dba_jobs cleared it all. While doing the initial load with expdp/impdp, job also got imported and some of them were in not broken state. They were firing according to their schedule and making changes to data in the target. So before GG came to update/insert record the job had already done its game and the replicat was hitting different errors. We did the initial load again (this time by using flashback_scn in the running database), disabled all the jobs and ran the replicat. It went through without any errors.\nSo things to take care of, in such cases:\nDisable all the triggers on the target side (or exclude triggers while running expdp)\nLook for and disable any scheduled jobs (could be dba_jobs, dba_scheduler_jobs or cron)\nHappy GoldenGate\u0026rsquo;ing !\nComments Comment by Arunkumar A on 2018-03-13 12:11:07 +0530 INSERTMISSINGUPDATES add this parameter and start\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2011/11/04/ogg-01004-aborted-grouped-transaction-on-database-error-1403/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"/blog/2011/11/04/expdp-not-consistent/\"\u003elast post\u003c/a\u003e was just like that.

It can vary between dbc_min_pct and dbc_max_pct percent of the total RAM. They default to 5 and 50 respectively. For a system that is running an Oracle database value of 50 for dbc_max_pct is way too high. That means half of the memory is going to be allocated to OS buffer cache. As Oracle has got its own buffer cache so the OS cache is not of much use. As mentioned in the metalink note 726652.1, the value of dbc_max_pct can be safely lowered without impacting the Oracle database performance. In many of the threads (on HP website) people have suggested the value of 10 for db_max_pct.

The size of the database was around 800 GB. The major applications connecting to the database were developed in Pro*C and Oracle Forms. The upgrade itself pretty smooth but there were few glitches around that needed to be handled. Just thought about documenting all the issues:\nFew users in the database were assigned the CREATE SESSION privilege through a password protected role (That role was the default role for that user). 10.2.0.5 onwards, password protected roles can’t be set as default roles. The alternate is to either disable the password for the role or assign CREATE SESSION directly to the user, not through a role.\nAfter the upgrade, few procedures became invalid and while compiling started giving ORA-00918: COLUMN AMBIGUOUSLY DEFINED. The issue was bug 2846640 which is fixed in 10.2. Actually, in few of the queries using ANSI syntax, the developer didn’t qualify the column names with table names. It worked fine in 9i but due to the bug getting fixed in 10g, it started giving ORA-00918. The simple solution is to prefix the column name with the table name.\nFew of the application schema owner users complained that they were not able to modify the procedures/packages in their own schemas. The schemas were not assigned CREATE PROCEDURE privilege but as per documentation, they should be able to modify the existing procedures/packages owned by them. This again is a documentation bug. It worked fine in 9i but in 10g onwards you need to have either a CREATE PROCEDURE or ALTER ANY PROCEDURE privilege (a risky one) to be able to edit the PL/SQL units in your own schema.\nThese were few of the issues encountered, rest of the upgrade was super smooth !\nHappy upgrading !\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2011/01/29/issues-in-upgrading-from-9i-to-10g/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eLast week I had a chance to upgrade a 9.2.0.7 database to 10.2.0.5.

It was a great opportunity to meet so many fellow Oracle professionals and most awesomely to meet \u0026amp; see Jonathan Lewis talk about Performance \u0026amp; Tuning. As expected the whole experience was amazing. It was a 2 day event where Jonathan was delivering 2 half day seminars on SQL Tuning and there were other break out sessions as well. We had planned to go a day in advance so me, Aman, Ankit \u0026amp; Neeraj reached Hyderabad on 2nd Sep.\nJonathan\u0026rsquo;s presentations were simply amazing. His knowledge about how things work (and why they work this way not that) is simply awesome. He is an inspiration for newbies like us and there was so much to learn from him. Few of the quick tips that i picked up from him:\nDon\u0026rsquo;t believe what you read or hear. Make small test cases to test and confirm how things work \u0026amp; how they don\u0026rsquo;t. He said that he has around 2000 test cases on his laptop. Some of them ready to be fired on Oracle database 12g ;) . Always document your findings. At a later date you only won\u0026rsquo;t be able to remember that something that you already faced and solved something you are stuck in. If you document things properly, you would always remember a bit of it and you can search it in a minute. Also i got to meet \u0026amp; attend presentation of good friend Francisco Munoz Alvarez. I have been in touch with him since more than 2 years but this was for the first time i was meeting him in person. Also his presentation on how to become a good DBA was really awesome. Enjoyed every bit of it.\nTwo of my colleagues Vivek Sharma and Rahul Dutta were also presenting, so got a chance to see their presentations too. Vivek talked about developing scalable applications and Rahul\u0026rsquo;s presentation was about developing a EBS reporting solution using Oracle streams.\nI attended some part of Mark Rittman\u0026rsquo;s session also. I am not much into data warehousing but Mark is such a respected name so wanted to be present in his session ;) .\nI also met and attended one of the presentation of Iggy Fernandez. He talked about 52 weeks in the life of a database. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t attend his other presentation on reading execution plans as Vivek was presnting in the same time slot.\nOverall, it was an amazing experience and i am already looking forward to attending Sangam (or whatever it would be called ;) ) 11 !\nRead Aman\u0026rsquo;s post about Sangam 10.\nComments Comment by Vaibhav on 2010-09-12 17:23:26 +0530 Good event man.. not like the cloud computing one we went to from Microsoft 🙂\nComment by Sidhu on 2010-09-12 21:29:38 +0530 haha…it was really good one.\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2010/09/12/sangam-10/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt has been almost an year since i posted something (useful) here.

With the hope that i would be able to explain it properly, the whole scenario is like this:\nUser will log in to the application with his username (Lets say USER01) and password (basically every application user is a database user). He is provided with a screen where he can enter details about the job and the code behind the button calls a PL/SQL procedure in the main application schema (lets say APP1) which in turn uses DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB to schedule the new job. The ultimate task of the job is to move data from one table in the first database to a table in the second database using a DB Link. There is a VPD policy applied on all the application users to restrict the view of data. Policy function uses SYS_CONTEXT to fetch some information about the logged in user. The main application user APP1 is exempted from policy and can see the whole data. Things seem to work fine till the schedule part. But when the job runs it hits ORA-02070: database does not support operator SYS_CONTEXT in this context as SYS_CONTEXT and DB link doesn\u0026rsquo;t go together.\nI did a bit of troubleshooting and came to know that the job gets created with JOB_CREATOR (a field in DBA_SCHEDULER_JOBS) as the user who is logged in (ie USER001). Now when the job runs from USER001, there is a VPD policy which is going to append a where clause to the query and there is a DB link being used, hence ORA-02070.\nSo the way out would be to schedule and run the job from some user that has no VPD policy applied to it. The best choice would obviously be the main application user; APP1 but as the user logs in with his own username so the job would always be created with JOB_CREATOR as USER001. After a bit of thought provoking an idea hit me:\nCreate a table in the APP1 schema. Now when the user schedules the job, insert the values of the parameters required to schedule the job in the table. Schedule one master job in APP1 schema which would read this table and in turn call DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB to schedule the job required by the user. Now as there is no policy applied on the APP1 database user so the job is not going to hit ORA-02070. The frequency of the master job can be set as per the requirements. To identify which entries in the table have been processed either keep a flag which can be updated or delete the record from the table after scheduling.\nThat is how it clicked in my mind at that time.

I checked out his CV and wrote down around 8 questions on a paper, just to make sure that i myself don\u0026rsquo;t get confused during the interview ;) . So i called him in the evening and started with introduction and his present job profile. Then i started with the questions from the projects he had done. He was confident about the stuff he was handling and replied all the questions honestly, saying NO at points where he didn\u0026rsquo;t know or was not involved in something. One of such thing was testing the backups. He said there is no testing done as such.\nIn his CV he had written about Data Guard also. So i asked few data guard questions like what is the difference in working of physical and logical standby ? He was not aware about some of the data types not being supported in logical standby.\nOverall he answered the questions pretty confidently and honestly. So at the end, i recommended his induction into the company :)\nHappy Ending !\nBTW from the first experience i can say that it feels good to be on the other side of table (or phone).\nComments Comment by amritpal singh on 2008-08-04 00:52:18 +0530 sahi hai Sidhu saab\nComment by Manikya on 2008-08-04 13:25:00 +0530 Plz tell me if that guy was finally selected by Higher recruitment management level …\nHere i want to see what is the fate of Technically Recommended person at the hands of Non Technical Managers …!!!\nComment by Sidhu on 2008-08-04 21:55:43 +0530 @Manikya\nI don’t really know what happened later on.

Most of the times you meet people who don’t even know what CHECKPOINTS are! And fake resumes show up every now and then.. The tragedy is that there are just not enough of good DBAs around and you tend to compromise on the quality of people that are hired!!\nComment by Sidhu on 2008-08-20 22:42:49 +0530 @Puja\nSo, you too familiar with this beast called Oracle 🙂\nYea, it is, indeed. Quality resources are just so rare and if there are a few, companies are not ready to pay what they ask for. Moreover the way Indian companies are going for quantity of resources (Yea, number of employees is a factor 😉 ) the quality is bound to go down.\nFake resumes are also a headache but i guess if the interviewer is OK, one carrying fake CV can’t go far. Will get caught soon in CHECKPOINTS and SCNs 😉\nComment by Puja on 2008-08-20 23:50:39 +0530 Oh yes, am a big fan of oracle. was working as an Oracle DBA before quitting.\nIn one of the companies that I worked with, they took fresh graduates, trained them on SQL, and put them to work as DBAs!! I am sure within a year, they would project themselves as ‘experienced’ DBAs! And then if the interviewer is smart, they would get trapped in the vicious world of CHECKPOINTS and SCNs!!\nComment by Sidhu on 2008-08-21 07:08:42 +0530 You know what, i would say even thats good that they are at least training them on SQL. I have seen the scenarios where they were not taught anything and still asked to manage databases.\nSo as you said, after 1-2 years they would be so called “experienced” DBAs with 2 years of ex in this that blah blah. Sad indeed.\nThis,specially is the case with the Indian companies. I have never seen them doing any skill based recruitment. They keep on adding people and then throw randomly here and there…where few of them become DBAs, others Unix administrators and so on. So jinna gur panuge unna mitha houga anusaar, things get nowhere.\nBTW how do you feel after quitting ? Don’t you miss all this ? Any plans in future to join back ?\nComment by Puja on 2008-08-22 22:48:04 +0530 Well, I am not too sure about that! The way these people land the database (and eventually themselves) in trouble, I wish it would make the recruiters take a little more pain in identifying the right resource..\nOn a tangential note, my previous company recruited me (an Oracle DBA) while it was a database designer they were looking for!!!\nI had quit the job while I was into fourth month of my pregnancy. I had to do so for medical reasons. Ever since then I have enjoyed every single moment of my pregnancy and motherhood, so no regrets whatsoever 🙂 I do miss the technical stuff at times, and wish to resume at some point of time. As of now, I am busy trying to find out work from home options. Any ideas?\nComment by Sidhu on 2008-08-25 07:37:49 +0530 Fine, that is an integral part of life.\nIn India that would be an issue. I am not aware of any such thing as work from home. With database it becomes even more difficult.

There are free options, like regex coach and a few free online options, but the problem is you have to find one that matches the Oracle specific Posix ERE format.

Someone asked a question about UNDO tablespace wrt to a scenario. The question was:\nThere is a database and its hot backup is taken on Friday. Now for Saturday, Sunday and Monday there are archive logs but no backups. Suppose the machine crashes on Monday. After we restore the database to Friday (from backup), recovery will happen. As UNDO tablespace is of Friday so it has no information related to transactions that happened on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. So in the end of recovery process when we need to rollback some transactions from where that required information will come ?\nHoward did 3 beautiful follow ups of this post, explaining how UNDO works. Just saving it here for quick reference. Hope its no copyright mess :)\nFollow up 1:\nYes, it can certainly be confusing, especially when you get told completely incorrect information! As has already (and thankfully!) been pointed out, redo logs contain redo change records from both committed and uncommitted transactions.\nThe answer to your question is that as we re-perform transactions by applying redo in a recovery session, we redo exactly what would have been done when the transactions were first performed. That is, we\u0026rsquo;d see a redo change record that says (in effect) update EMP set sal=900 where ename=\u0026lsquo;Bob\u0026rsquo;, so we\u0026rsquo;d find the Bob record in the restored Friday copy of the data file, and we\u0026rsquo;d lock that record. Then we\u0026rsquo;d store details of Bob\u0026rsquo;s existing salary in an undo block. Then we\u0026rsquo;d store the new and old salaries in redo (yup, recovery generates redo!). Then we\u0026rsquo;d change the Bob record itself.\nIf that\u0026rsquo;s all that\u0026rsquo;s in the archives and online redo logs, that\u0026rsquo;s all that happens: Bob\u0026rsquo;s record is left locked and changed. At the end of the recovery process, we realise that a lot of re-performed transactions need rolling back, so SMON does that\u0026hellip;. and it knows what to roll the stuff back to because in re-performing the transactions, we generated fresh undo.\nSo your question says, \u0026ldquo;how does the uncommited transactions rolled back with the Friday undo tablespace since they do [not] have latest uncommited trnsactions\u0026rdquo;, but that\u0026rsquo;s not right. The undo tablespace certainly STARTS at the state it was in on Friday. But as recovery proceeds, it gets \u0026lsquo;freshened up\u0026rsquo;, because the new transactions generate fresh undo.\n(A slightly more accurate description would be to point out that when you generated undo on Saturday and Sunday, those changes to the undo blocks would themselves have generated redo. Therefore, your redo stream, archives and online alike, have the necessary information to recover the undo tablespace. Personally, I don\u0026rsquo;t find that any more informative than thinking that applying redo generates fresh undo, but it\u0026rsquo;s up to you which mental model you prefer to work with).\nFollow up 2:\n\u0026gt;does \u0026ldquo;recovery generates redo\u0026rdquo; mean that during recovery we regenerate the same amount \u0026gt;of redo that was generated since the last backup\nNo, it\u0026rsquo;s not the same. If you do a simple test, you\u0026rsquo;ll see that. Update EMP, commit, check with Log Miner that the redo is in the logs in analyzable form. The blow up your database, restore it and recover it. Your log sequence number will have moved on, redo will have been generated\u0026hellip; but you can mine the logs till Christmas and you won\u0026rsquo;t find a second \u0026lsquo;update EMP\u0026rsquo; set of redo records.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s why I mentioned the \u0026lsquo;more accurately\u0026rsquo; bit further on in my original reply. Recovery is a bit more subtle than just sitting there issuing a lot of insert/update/delete statements as if from the keyboard of an incredibly fast typist! Metaphorically you can say, \u0026ldquo;We repeat transactions during recovery\u0026rdquo;. But actually, it\u0026rsquo;s \u0026ldquo;we apply redo change vectors\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; and that doesn\u0026rsquo;t generate a one-for-one amount of redo as the original transactions did.\n\u0026gt;Will there be duplicate archive logs then?\nNo. Do the Log Mining test to see this for yourself. The updates you did before the blow-up will not be visible in the logs from after (or during) the recovery.\n\u0026gt;Can we say that the undo tablespace starts from scratch with no undo at all\nI\u0026rsquo;m not sure what you\u0026rsquo;re getting at, but an undo segment is just a special sort of table, and it\u0026rsquo;s got data stored in it, even if the transactions that placed them there are long-since finished. So when you restore that file on Monday, it comes back in the state it was in when it was backed up -with data in it. Leaving aside undo_retention for a moment, it follows from the fact that you\u0026rsquo;re doing a database recovery that none of the stuff inside the rollback segments is related to \u0026ldquo;live\u0026rdquo; transactions, therefore all of it is over-writeable. So in that sense, yes, you could say the undo tablespace, just after restore and just before recovery, is \u0026lsquo;clean\u0026rsquo;.\nFollow up 3:\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t give \u0026ldquo;2 ideas\u0026rdquo;. I gave just one. I just happened to give you the option of thinking of it in two different ways.\nApplying redo causes transactions to be re-performed. That is the only, solo, number 1, all on its own, lonely idea being conveyed here.\nNow you can describe the re-performance of transactions either as \u0026ldquo;re-doing the transactions\u0026rdquo; as if some virtual user were sitting there typing insert, update and delete statements maniacally fast. That\u0026rsquo;s the way I usually think of it, largely because that\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like when you use Log Miner to peer inside the logs. Or you can think of it in a slightly more technical and accurate way, of taking the description of changes to byte-data which the redo change vectors represent and re-applying those changes.\nThey\u0026rsquo;re both descriptions of exactly the same process with the same outcome. They just happen to use different words to describe them because some people\u0026rsquo;s mental models of what is happening work better with one than the other. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t help, however, to start thinking that somehow I\u0026rsquo;ve described two different processes.\nBy way of a rather stretched analogy. Suppose you are a photographer. You take a lovely colour photograph of a landscape. You make a couple of copies of this photograph. The copy you framed and took especial care of one day gets damaged. Now, you can either repair that photo by going back to the scene, setting up the camera in the exact spot as before, waiting until the light conditions are exactly as they were, and then re-taking the shot. Or you can take the existing photo, compare it with another copy of the photo, and where you are lacking red/green/blue information in the damaged picture, you \u0026lsquo;paint in\u0026rsquo; the corresponding red/blue/green values determined from the other print. Either way, you end up with a new photograph that looks like the old one did, and that\u0026rsquo;s the important thing: you end up with a restored print to hang back on your wall.\nTechnically, Oracle recoveries apply deltas to existing data, rather than re-performing transactions as if done by a human being with very fast fingers. So that\u0026rsquo;s the \u0026ldquo;truth\u0026rdquo; if you want to think in those terms. But the core fact is, recovery restores data and it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really matter precisely HOW that\u0026rsquo;s done: whatever description we give for the process will be \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo;, in either case, because only people who have seen the source code know *actually* how it\u0026rsquo;s done. So, I just as happily thing of \u0026ldquo;very fast fingers\u0026rdquo; as \u0026ldquo;applying deltas\u0026rdquo;, and in fact, I prefer that mental model. I just gave you the choice of models, in other words. But don\u0026rsquo;t, please, confuse that with their being two mechanisms.\nI have no idea why on Earth anyone participating in this thread is so hung up about the undo tablespace. The central question appears to be, \u0026lsquo;How can an undo tablespace from Friday help in the recovery of a database the following Monday\u0026rsquo;. But I explained that the first time and 20 posts ago! Very simply, during a recovery, the undo tablespace gets rolled forward like any other part of the database. It gets redo applied to it just as much as the USERS tablespace does. At the end of the rolled forward process, your undo tablespace is effectively a Monday tablespace. It\u0026rsquo;s fresh. It\u0026rsquo;s got all the undo generated by the weekend\u0026rsquo;s transactions in it. And there\u0026rsquo;s a bunch of transactions which were uncomitted at the time the database blew up, so although recovery blindly replayed those transactions and therefore re-performed them, they are left there in an uncommitted state and SMON goes ahead and rolls them back (users also help, but SMON does the bulk of the work).\nAnd SMON knows what to roll the uncommitted transactions back to because all the undo needed to do that was FRESHLY created by the recovery\u0026rsquo;s roll forward phase.\nYou don\u0026rsquo;t need to read anything into the sentence in bold that isn\u0026rsquo;t there in plain English. You have to stop looking for deep and secret meanings and just read the words that are there: Your redo, whether it comes from the online logs or the archives, contains all the information necessary to recover the undo tablespace. Just as it has all the information necessary to recover ANY tablespace, in fact.\nThink of an undo segment just as if it were the EMP segment, or the DEPT segment. You don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be bothered about EMP or DEPT being restored from Friday and yet managing to be recovered to the state they were in on Monday. Neither should anyone be surprised that a Friday undo segment can be transformed into a Monday undo segment. That is, after all, what recovery does.\nRecovery is the application of redo to a datafile to make it and the segments it contains -be they \u0026ldquo;ordinary\u0026rdquo; segments like tables and indexes, or more \u0026ldquo;exotic\u0026rdquo; segments like undo segments- more up\u0026ndash;to-date. That means recovery is the \u0026ldquo;rolling forward in time of a datafile\u0026rdquo;.\nBut when we start rolling forward, we can\u0026rsquo;t predict the future. So when I see \u0026ldquo;update EMP set sal=900\u0026rdquo; in the redo stream, I do not yet know whether you managed to commit that or not. I can\u0026rsquo;t see ahead. So I just blindly re-play that update and keep my fingers crossed. And I do that for every transaction recorded in the redo stream. And in the process of replaying that transaction, I also re-generate the fact that the original salaries in the EMP table were 800\u0026hellip; which means I\u0026rsquo;ve just re-generated the undo for the EMP transaction.\nOnly at the end of the roll forward phase can I look around and see, \u0026lsquo;Ah, that one wasn\u0026rsquo;t committed; neither was that one; and this one wasn\u0026rsquo;t even finished when the database blew up\u0026rsquo;. I therefore set SMON to work rolling those uncommitted transactions back\u0026hellip; and it is at THAT point that the undo tablespace, storing that freshly-recreated undo, becomes vital for completing the recovery process.\nIn words of few syllables: every recovery requires a roll forward and a roll back phase. Redo lets us roll things forward. Undo allows us to do the roll back. The undo tablespace is vital to recovering a database, therefore, because without it, half the job couldn\u0026rsquo;t be done.\nSidhu\nComments Comment by Aman Sharma on 2007-10-14 17:41:00 +0530 Hi sidhu,\nHoward is a GREAT GREAT teacher and extremely knowledgeable person.I welcome you to read these two topics.I am sure you will be delighted with his wisdom.And the same goes for Tim also.\nHave a read:\nAbout SCNs internals\nhttp://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/1003\nAbout FAST_START_MTTR_TARGET internals\nhttp://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/1040\nI am sure you will laugh at my little knowledge when will read the questions :)!\nThanks for the thread!It was amazing to read it!\nCheers,\nAman….\nComment by Sidhu on 2007-10-14 17:48:00 +0530 True Aman,\nI am a big fan of Howard’s writings.

But never cared for it much and understood what exactly it meant to say ?\nYesterday I was reading System Admin guide to Linux by Lars Wirzenius (Thanks Howard for the link :) From there I came to know what exactly that message meant. Quoting from the guide itself:\nUnfortunately, the BIOS has a design limitation, which makes it impossible to specify a track number that is larger than 1024 in the CMOS RAM, which is too little for a large hard disk. To overcome this, the hard disk controller lies about the geometry, and translates the addresses given by the computer into something that fits reality. For example, a hard disk might have 8 heads, 2048 tracks, and 35 sectors per track. Its controller could lie to the computer and claim that it has 16 heads, 1024 tracks, and 35 sectors per track, thus not exceeding the limit on tracks, and translates the address that the computer gives it by halving the head number, and doubling the track number. The mathematics can be more complicated in reality, because the numbers are not as nice as here (but again, the details are not relevant for understanding the principle). This translation distorts the operating system\u0026rsquo;s view of how the disk is organized, thus making it impractical to use the all-data-on-one-cylinder trick to boost performance\u0026hellip;.When using IDE disks, the boot partition (the partition with the bootable kernel image files) must be completely within the first 1024 cylinders. This is because the disk is used via the BIOS during boot (before the system goes into protected mode), and BIOS can\u0026rsquo;t handle more than 1024 cylinders. It is sometimes possible to use a boot partition that is only partly within the first 1024 cylinders. This works as long as all the files that are read with the BIOS are within the first 1024 cylinders. Since this is difficult to arrange, it is a very bad idea to do it; you never know when a kernel update or disk defragmentation will result in an unbootable system. Therefore, make sure your boot partition is completely within the first 1024 cylinders.\nHope it clears the logic why Linux cries about 1024 cylinder issue at the time of installation.\nYou can read the guide online from the link above and download the pdf here. Its simple and concise and just too good.

Its for Unix based systems only, as I am not aware of any pipe type functionality in Windows. The biggest advantage is that you can save lots of space as uncompressing a file makes it almost 5 times or more. (Suppose you are uncompressing a file of 20 GB, it will make 100 GB) As a newbie I faced this problem, so thought about writing a post.\nLets talk about export first. The method used is that create a pipe, write to a pipe(ie the file in exp command is the pipe we created), side by side read the contents of pipe, compress (in the background) and redirect to a file. Here is the script that achieves this:\n[sourcecode language=\u0026lsquo;css\u0026rsquo;]export ORACLE_SID=MYDB rm -f ?/myexport.pipe mkfifo ?/myexport.pipe cat ?/myexport.pipe |compress \u0026gt; ?/myexport.dmp.Z \u0026amp; sleep 5 exp file=?/myexport.pipe full=Y log=myexport.log\n[/sourcecode]\nSame way for import, we create a pipe, zcat from the dmp.Z file, redirect it to the pipe and then read from pipe:\n[sourcecode language=\u0026lsquo;css\u0026rsquo;]export ORACLE_SID=MYDB rm -f ?/myimport.pipe mkfifo ?/myimport.pipe zcat ?/myexport.dmp.Z \u0026gt; ?/myimport.pipe \u0026amp; sleep 5 imp file=myimport.pipe full=Y show=Y log=?/myimport.log[/sourcecode]\nIn case there is any issue with the script, do let me know :)\nUpdate: If you are on Wintel, you can directly use a compressed folder as an export target. No need to create a pipe as the file system will automatically do it for you. ( Thanks Noons for the tip)\nIf you are using gunzip:\nFor export:\n[sourcecode language=\u0026lsquo;css\u0026rsquo;]export ORACLE_SID=MYDB rm -f exp.pipe mknod exp.pipe gzip \u0026lt; exp.pipe \u0026gt; T1.dmp.gz \u0026amp; exp file=exp.pipe full=Y log=myexport.log\n[/sourcecode]\nFor import:\n[sourcecode language=\u0026lsquo;css\u0026rsquo;]export ORACLE_SID=MYDB rm -f imp.pipe mknod imp.pipe gzip \u0026lt; T1.dmp.gz \u0026gt; imp.pipe \u0026amp; imp file=imp.pipe full=Y log=myimport.log\n[/sourcecode]\nUpdate: I came across an article that discusses few ways to achieve the same on Windows. Check it here.\nComments Comment by Noons on 2007-06-27 17:34:00 +0530 Suggestion: in Wintel you could use a compressed folder as the target for the export file.\nNo need for the pipe as the file system does it for you automagically.\nComment by Gabriela on 2008-08-01 20:06:11 +0530 I want to do compressed export on the fly, but may database is big and in my export I need to put filesize=5G and I had 12 files until now, then I want to do compressed export but using more than 1 file.\nCan you help me?\nComment by Sidhu on 2008-08-03 21:53:40 +0530 Hi\nWhen you pass filesize=5g to exp, it is handled by Oracle and it knows that it is creating multiple files. When we import it back and pass all the file names, again Oracle is aware that “I created these files and i know how to read them in sequence”.\nBut here we do a trick: we create a pipe, feed it from one end and redirect the other end to a file and ask OS to compress it. Now this is entirely an OS thing. Oracle is writing to only one file that is export pipe !\nRight now nothing is hitting my mind, but if something is possible, i think that has again to be done at OS level. exp doesn’t understand anything like compression of files.\nIf you come to know something, do let me know 🙂\nComment by Aman\u0026hellip;. on 2008-08-04 11:32:08 +0530 Gabriel,\nAs Sidhu already mentioned,there is no way by whch export files can understand compression. There is a limit that oracle puts over the export file and that’s 2g. That’s what they maintain.For the compression either you have to use the filesize option or use a pipe to compress it. Here are two links that you can use as a refenece for using a pipe.\nhttp://www.tc.umn.edu/~hause011/code/exp-imp-db.ksh\nhttp://www.jlcomp.demon.co.uk/faq/bigexp.html\nHTH\nAman….\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/06/06/import-export-from-to-compressed-files-directly/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell, a simple method to import(export) directly to(from) compressed files using pipes.

Combining all the thoughts, here is the summary of all the methods that you can use ;)\nWater the motherboard: Add a bit of salt to water, fill a syringe and use it to spread water on the motherboard before booting. It will blow the motherboard. Stop processor\u0026rsquo;s fan: One more thing put something in the processer\u0026rsquo;s fan to stop it so that processor gets heated and it stops :) but here chances are more that the system will shutdown or restart. Break pin(s) of processor: Another interesting and simple thing that you can do is, break one or more pins of processor and put it back in the slot. Remove one or more ICs: Another thing that you can do is remove one or more ICs from the board. As the board is already so clumsy, nobody can see that anything has been removed from there. Use Pencil: Use a carbon pencil and rub it on the golden plating of RAM slots, any ICs near CPU or BIOS. Its gonna spoil that ;) Cut some wire: A very simple method you can use is that cut some wires or data cables in such a way that nobody can see it ;) One update from comments posted by Vaibhav: Most of u might not know abt the voltage selector switch at the back of the SMPS in the CPU tower. It is there to select between 110V(american) and 230V(indian). The trick is to just switch it to 110V :) The SMPS has no protection of over voltage at this high level and will burn instantly.\nAdvantages:\n-No need to open PC\n-No Smoke or sparks\n-Nothing can be found on u if checked(like syringe, screw driver or wire cutter)\n-Instant\n-One Second Job\n-Can be done again and again if system repaired\nDisadvantages:\n-Replacing SMPS makes the system operational\nWell, few things you can try if you too have an old computer in the office.

Winamp: No need to say anything. Winamp is possibly the best and lightest mp3 (these days videos also) player. Just run Winamp in the system tray and enjoy\n2. Winrar: Utility to uncompress compressed files. Earlier winzip was my favorite but recently I swichted to Winrar as Winzip doesn\u0026rsquo;t support rar format. I am pretty happy using it.\n3. Mozilla: I have almost stopped using Internet Explorer (except with some of the websites which say flat NO, sort of, to Mozilla). It is really good. With this I have stopped using any standalone download manager (DAP and Flashget have been among my favorites) also as Mozilla has one inbuilt and there are many addons also available.\n4. Messengers: The latest communication channel: messengers. Latest versions of Yahoo, Gtalk and Skype.\n5. uTorrent: Recently I started using torrents also. uTorrent, I am using as torrent client. It is light weight and pretty heavy to use. The only issue I have with it is that there is no feature like automatic bandwidth management. I have manually set a speed for download and upload as assiging the full badwidth to utorrent screws up normal surfing. And with manual settings when I am not surfing some of the bandwidth goes wasted ;)\n6. Realplayer Alternate: I was a typical user who would stick with Real Player though its pretty heavy and eats a lot of resources. Sometime back my friend Vaibhav suggested me to go for Real Player alternate. I am happy using it now. very simple, small and precise :)\n7. Replay Music: Just a new thing in my life too. A tool to record streaming audio, infact any audio coming out of sound card. Good one, saves as mp3 and has a very simple interface, just start, stop buttons and you are done.\n8. RSS reader: Again a new item I am experimenting with. Till now I havn\u0026rsquo;t been able to find a good one. Generally the interface is clumsy and you don\u0026rsquo;t enjoy reading in that small window. I used RSS Reader first and using Omea Reader these days.\nFSL Super finder: A replacement of windows search. I never liked (I seem to hate, indeed) windows search after Windows 2000. In XP it is totally screwed up. This one is a free utility with good interface and speed. Use of all these tools makes me a happy user \u0026amp; surfer :)\nCheers Sidhu\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/04/16/utilities-i-cant-survive-without/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWell, here I am listing down the important tools and utilities I seem to use on the daily basis and without them life on internet \u0026amp; laptop really seems to be stuck, sort of :(\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e1.

In the evening I was working on my laptop and everything was fine. Next day in the morning when I got up, switched on the laptop and clicked on IE icon, it happily gave a beautiful error message \u0026ldquo;This application failed to start because msvcrl.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix the problem.\u0026rdquo; So it was the time for Googling about the error. Thank God I had Opera installed. After 2-3 hits I came to know that it was a trojan. Finally, there was one dll which needed to be deleted to get rid of this error message :) But after that there was some problem with IE in opening some of the sites. One option was to upgrade to IE 7 but don\u0026rsquo;t know why, I havn\u0026rsquo;t started liking IE 7 yet. So no other option left than restoring windows (I have Windows XP Media Center Edition installed).\nOn all the laptops HP creates a partition where they store all the crap to restore windows back to original condition. They call it recovery partition (It eats upto 11-12 Gigs of space and recovers nothing really :( In the recovery tool provided by HP, there are 2 options one is called normal recovery which will restore the OS and won\u0026rsquo;t touch your data (They say so but I read many posts where people talked about having lost everything to this so called normal recovery :( another is called destructive recovery (I just love the name :-* ) which erases everything on the hard drive and restore back the system to factory shipped condition (Term courtesy HP). Obviously I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to lose any data. So I tried with normal recovery and it didn\u0026rsquo;t work actually. So I contacted HP for the same and asked about any other option. They said NO in a very stylish manner as technical people are taught to do.\nNow the only option left was to go for destructive recovery. I got some blanks DVDs and burned the data so as to free my hard drive. Finally after a few hours of work my hard drive was ready to face destructive recovery. I ran the tool and it worked out something for around 40 mins showing me a progress bar for which I waited to complete as a lover would wait for his watch to strike the moment when his sweet heart has to come :) Finally it was 100% complete and system rebooted. You know to find everything intact as if not even touched. So started looking for why the hell this 12 GB recovery partition if it has to do nothing ?\nI also had Fedora Core installed so one thought struck that might be possible it is not able to do because of those Linux partitions, so deleted those partitions also and then tried but of no use. Finally only one thing was left that delete all the partitions and give the whole space to one partition and then try. Thank God it worked and my laptop was back with a fresh installation of windows. (Later on I came to know that existing of more than one partition was the reason why normal recovery also didn\u0026rsquo;t work and few more interesting things - in all the cases it didn\u0026rsquo;t give any error that was not able to restore or something and in case of normal recovery they delete all the softwares installed later but their shortcuts will still be there ? ridiclous, foolish, stupid ). I already had made my mind to make Norton Ghost image of the C drive to avoid this operation again in future. Before making the image, many things had to be done like configuring internet connection, updating windows, installation of some utilities \u0026amp; uninstalling Norton Internet Security that I got pre-installed along with the OS.\nI use Sify broadband for internet. So installed the sify dialer and when I tried to connect it gave one strange bloody,out of hell message that \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have any anti-virus installed, click here to download updated antivirus from Sify\u0026rdquo;. I just can\u0026rsquo;t understand why the hell Sify is worried about anti-virus on my system. As I said at sometimes you just can\u0026rsquo;t do anything, had to install Norton Internet Security again to be able to connect to internet. Later on I got another command based dialer Supersify for Sify from internet developed by an individual (Many thanks to him (using it I can connect to internet with AVG Free anti-virus installed which is not recognised by Sify\u0026rsquo;s dialer as a good anti-virus) \u0026amp; one of my friend Vaibhav who googled this thing for me and was with me on voice during whole of this story which lasted for a day, a good short story it could make on a TV channel broadcasting peoples\u0026rsquo; frustrations with the technology) So after sweating out for one full day my laptop was back to normal :)\nPS: If you just got a laptop and Windows is in fine condition, please make an image of your C drive using some tool. Other wise probably you also have to write a blog ;)\nSidhu\nComments Comment by RollerCoaster on 2007-04-02 11:24:00 +0530 That is windows for you.\ntho i am angry u did not include my name in the article, after all i was the one providing you with all the support!

It was about an article titled A Note To Employers: 8 Things Intelligent People, Geeks and Nerds Need To Work Happily. Well first of all meaning of all three words from \u0026ldquo;define: * in Google\u0026rdquo;\n1. Intelligent: having the capacity for thought and reason especially to a high degree\n2. Geek: In computers and the Internet, a geekis a person who is inordinately dedicated to and involved with the technologyto the point of sometimes not appearing to be like the rest of us (non-geeks).Being a geek also implies a capability with the technology.\n3. Nerd: A computer expert by aptitude and not mere training. Usually male, under the age of 35 and socially inept; a person whose tremendous skill with operating or designing computer hardware or software is exceeded only by his, rarely her, passionate love of the technology.\nSo all the three words refer to some exceptional class of people, not everybody ;) Here are my views about all the points:\n1. Yes flexible timings is a big thing. Different classes of people are there. One that can work in morning, another late night so and so and one that can\u0026rsquo;t anytime (but this article is not for those ;)\n2. Yes everybody likes different kind of environment around. I like greenry and natural things, if possible :) \u0026amp; the nap thing i strongly agree to ;)\n3. Except while sleeping and listening to some classical genre of music, I need light :)\n4. Nice idea. \u0026amp; I ALMOST HATE those people talking on the phone everytime, specially sales people \u0026amp; managers.\n5. Yes. No suits and formals. It is upto you whatever you like. Reid \u0026amp; Taylor Suits are ok for James Bond in 007 series but are not going to help in bringing up a server from crash or catching an exception that has propagated to 5th-6th calling program because somebody didn\u0026rsquo;t handle it at proper place earlier :)\n6. Not a big issue. Just need the company of like minded people and it is fine :)\n7. Yes. No meetings just for the sake of meetings. We need work not meetings.\n8. It hurts the soul.\nSo those are all my views about this. Do post what you think ?\nCheers !\nSidhu\nComments Comment by Neeraj Bhatia on 2007-04-04 15:07:00 +0530 Whats this??\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2007/03/19/intelligent-people-geeks-and-nerds/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eI was checking \u003ca href=\"http://tkyte.blogspot.com/\"\u003eTom Kyte\u0026rsquo;s blog\u003c/a\u003e.

(Thanks Kyle Pott :)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI had downloaded Fedore Core 7 Live CD. Tried same with this method. It is working perfectly fine.

This problem was solved when I got my HP laptop last month and then internet connection this month. One thing I had heard much about was RSS feeds and also wanted to try the same because there were many blogs which I used to check regularly. I had an idea about the concept used by RSS feeds that you will need to install a piece of software on your PC, give link of the page you want it to monitor and it will inform you when there is something new since your last visit.(period) Nothing more I knew.\nSo as I generally do started looking for some good RSS reader(possibly the best ;). From the very first search in Google I opened the first link and downloaded RSS Reader and installed it. Then after installing, had to give the link of RSS feed for the page that you wanted it to monitor. It was very simple copy-paste kind of job. Just took around 2 mins. Now I have added many websites and blogs to it. Every time when there is something new it rings the bell :) Some of my favourite links: http://www.gurdasmaan.com/sforum/main.php Official Forum of Gurdas Maan http://tkyte.blogspot.com/ Blog of Tom Kyte http://asktom.oracle.com/ Hompage of Asktom http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/ Homepage of Jonathan Lewis http://www.jlcomp.demon.co.uk/ Website of Jonathan Lewis\nCheers !!!

If TRUE or omitted, an approximate match is returned. In other words, if an exact match is not found, the next largest value that is less than lookup_value is returned. If FALSE, VLOOKUP will find an exact match. If one is not found, the error value #N/A is returned(here 0 means false)\nnow why the range of values in which i am searching my value is written as\n$A$2:$A$6 not as A2:A6\u0026hellip;there is a logic behind this also\u0026hellip;if i write as A2:A6\u0026hellip;there will be one problem\u0026hellip;.suppose it picks up the first value and searches for it in the first column\u0026hellip;.and the value is found at 4th place\u0026hellip;.(place here means 4th row\u0026hellip;)\u0026hellip;then when it will search 2nd value\u0026hellip;it will start from 4th row only not 1st\u0026hellip;thatz not wat i want\u0026hellip;.so with $A$2:$A$6 i have fixed the range that every values is to be looked in this range only ie. first row to last row of first column\u0026hellip;\nhere is the screen shot of everything\nhope it makes using vlookup beautiful\u0026hellip;\nthanks for your time\n\u0026hellip;.Sidhu\n","permalink":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2006/09/27/small-things/","summary":"\u003cp\u003esometimes even very small things mess up everything in your head\u0026hellip;something similar happened with me also\u0026hellip;had two lists of numbers\u0026hellip;some numbers were missing in one\u0026hellip;wanted to find out thoes..instead of inserting values in tables then using SQL or using diff on Unix\u0026hellip;thought about using Excel for the same\u0026hellip;much heard about function VLOOKUP is there\u0026hellip;which we can use for such scenarios\u0026hellip;so I also tried the same\u0026hellip;.had heard a lot abt vlookup but was generally heard of it\u0026hellip;as when people used to write \u0026ldquo;=vlookup(bla bla bla bla\u0026hellip;)\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;i just used to count my heartbeat\u0026hellip;and look around\u0026hellip;so this was the time when i really needed to learn vlookup so as a normal computer geek wud do\u0026hellip;i opened google.com and started searching the same\u0026hellip;what i got was really disappointing\u0026hellip;.everywhere i almost found the same language\u0026hellip;.(oops\u0026hellip;.i also checked microsoft help even dat techie lingo didnt help as when you have messed up the things\u0026hellip;nothing really gets into your head\u0026hellip;.)\u0026hellip;some of that text\u0026hellip;m pasting here with a hope that it wont create copyright issues\u0026hellip;.i really got nothing out of this\u0026hellip;.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0026ldquo;Searches for a value in the leftmost column of a table, and then returns a value in the same row from a column you specify in the table.
