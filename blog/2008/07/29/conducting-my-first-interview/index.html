Will try to find out whether he was selected or not.\nComment by Puja on 2008-08-19 23:35:33 +0530 Conducting interviews is such a stressful job!! Most of the times you meet people who don‚Äôt even know what CHECKPOINTS are! And fake resumes show up every now and then.. The tragedy is that there are just not enough of good DBAs around and you tend to compromise on the quality of people that are hired!!\nComment by Sidhu on 2008-08-20 22:42:49 +0530 @Puja\nSo, you too familiar with this beast called Oracle üôÇ\nYea, it is, indeed. Quality resources are just so rare and if there are a few, companies are not ready to pay what they ask for. Moreover the way Indian companies are going for quantity of resources (Yea, number of employees is a factor üòâ ) the quality is bound to go down.\nFake resumes are also a headache but i guess if the interviewer is OK, one carrying fake CV can‚Äôt go far. Will get caught soon in CHECKPOINTS and SCNs üòâ\nComment by Puja on 2008-08-20 23:50:39 +0530 Oh yes, am a big fan of oracle. was working as an Oracle DBA before quitting.\nIn one of the companies that I worked with, they took fresh graduates, trained them on SQL, and put them to work as DBAs!! I am sure within a year, they would project themselves as ‚Äòexperienced‚Äô DBAs! And then if the interviewer is smart, they would get trapped in the vicious world of CHECKPOINTS and SCNs!!\nComment by Sidhu on 2008-08-21 07:08:42 +0530 You know what, i would say even thats good that they are at least training them on SQL. I have seen the scenarios where they were not taught anything and still asked to manage databases.\nSo as you said, after 1-2 years they would be so called ‚Äúexperienced‚Äù DBAs with 2 years of ex in this that blah blah. Sad indeed.\nThis,specially is the case with the Indian companies. I have never seen them doing any skill based recruitment. They keep on adding people and then throw randomly here and there‚Ä¶where few of them become DBAs, others Unix administrators and so on. So jinna gur panuge unna mitha houga anusaar, things get nowhere.\nBTW how do you feel after quitting ? Don‚Äôt you miss all this ? Any plans in future to join back ?\nComment by Puja on 2008-08-22 22:48:04 +0530 Well, I am not too sure about that! The way these people land the database (and eventually themselves) in trouble, I wish it would make the recruiters take a little more pain in identifying the right resource..\nOn a tangential note, my previous company recruited me (an Oracle DBA) while it was a database designer they were looking for!!!\nI had quit the job while I was into fourth month of my pregnancy. I had to do so for medical reasons. Ever since then I have enjoyed every single moment of my pregnancy and motherhood, so no regrets whatsoever üôÇ I do miss the technical stuff at times, and wish to resume at some point of time. As of now, I am busy trying to find out work from home options. Any ideas?\nComment by Sidhu on 2008-08-25 07:37:49 +0530 Fine, that is an integral part of life.\nIn India that would be an issue. I am not aware of any such thing as work from home. With database it becomes even more difficult. You must be looking for database stuff only ?\nFor some programming jobs, i think there could be something.\nWould let you know if i come across any information.\nComment by amritpal singh on 2008-11-23 02:28:27 +0530 man, even I took so many interviews here in my new job for pl-sql developer, Initially I was nervous, but now I am kind of getting hold of it. no one was selected though.\nand Puja I liked your blog page, and added your blog to my google reader list of blogs.\n","wordCount":"964","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2008-07-29T07:19:08+05:30","dateModified":"2008-07-29T07:19:08+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amardeep Sidhu"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2008/07/29/conducting-my-first-interview/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"amardeepsidhu.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://amardeepsidhu.com/ accesskey=h title="amardeepsidhu.com (Alt + H)">amardeepsidhu.com</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
