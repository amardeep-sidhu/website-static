Combining all the thoughts, here is the summary of all the methods that you can use ;)\nWater the motherboard: Add a bit of salt to water, fill a syringe and use it to spread water on the motherboard before booting. It will blow the motherboard. Stop processor‚Äôs fan: One more thing put something in the processer‚Äôs fan to stop it so that processor gets heated and it stops :) but here chances are more that the system will shutdown or restart. Break pin(s) of processor: Another interesting and simple thing that you can do is, break one or more pins of processor and put it back in the slot. Remove one or more ICs: Another thing that you can do is remove one or more ICs from the board. As the board is already so clumsy, nobody can see that anything has been removed from there. Use Pencil: Use a carbon pencil and rub it on the golden plating of RAM slots, any ICs near CPU or BIOS. Its gonna spoil that ;) Cut some wire: A very simple method you can use is that cut some wires or data cables in such a way that nobody can see it ;) One update from comments posted by Vaibhav: Most of u might not know abt the voltage selector switch at the back of the SMPS in the CPU tower. It is there to select between 110V(american) and 230V(indian). The trick is to just switch it to 110V :) The SMPS has no protection of over voltage at this high level and will burn instantly.\nAdvantages:\n-No need to open PC\n-No Smoke or sparks\n-Nothing can be found on u if checked(like syringe, screw driver or wire cutter)\n-Instant\n-One Second Job\n-Can be done again and again if system repaired\nDisadvantages:\n-Replacing SMPS makes the system operational\nWell, few things you can try if you too have an old computer in the office.
