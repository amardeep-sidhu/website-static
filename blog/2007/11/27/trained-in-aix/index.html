the same method but yes the flow of the slides or the knowledge shared is solely dependant on the trainer.Slides are just ment for references for the trainer and audience.I dont follow them that only what they contain will be told but yeah what they contain will be the main focus area rest will be just ‚Äòtouched‚Äô.There is always a schedule management that we have to do.Well I agree some what that training that too a full time is little boring.\nGuaranteed that you will not sleep in my class as my voice will not let you ;-).\nCheers,\nAman‚Ä¶.\nComment by Sidhu on 2007-11-29 23:34:00 +0530 Yup true‚Ä¶depends on the trainer‚Ä¶but this typical ppt method is dumb‚Ä¶there has to be very high level of interaction and smartness‚Ä¶the trainer has to be very active‚Ä¶funny‚Ä¶.as bearing this technical stuff (out of which not all you love) for whole of the day sitting in a classroom like kids is just impossible‚Ä¶\nyou have to crack jokes at times‚Ä¶make people feel lighter‚Ä¶\nyou have to make the flow very smooth‚Ä¶\n\u0026 most importantly you have to be an expert in your domain‚Ä¶that generates a lot of confidence in you and ‚Äúfeel good‚Äù factor in audience‚Ä¶\nIn whole of ma life‚Ä¶.in those typical dumb type sessions‚Ä¶mostly I have been sleeping except where there was a chance for some leg pulling üòâ\nSidhu\nComment by Aman Sharma on 2007-12-02 00:41:00 +0530 Agreed,as I said it depends again on the trainer itself.\nWell everyone is a different person in the training.I shallnot reveal my style here as its a live experience that one has to come and get ( just kidding ) but still I agree that ears of the audience starts bleeding when they hear so much tech jargons for almost 9 hours.\nPpts as I mentioned are just a way to organize time and material, they shouldnt be the sole method of training.Hmmm I guess time is there to make my sales team call your training dept and arrange some trainings for you guys.May be OU experience will change some things ;-).\nLastly, you know how it feels on the other side too(trainer side).You have been there done that right.Its not so easy believe me.Even if you are teaching the simplest subject to the dumbest audience too , its not so easy.But again,he the trainer is the caption of the cruise so he has to be for sure the best to keep the spirits alive of all aboard.\nCheers,\nAman‚Ä¶.\n","wordCount":"613","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2007-11-27T20:56:00+05:30","dateModified":"2007-11-27T20:56:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amardeep
