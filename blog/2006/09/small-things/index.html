If TRUE or omitted, an approximate match is returned. In other words, if an exact match is not found, the next largest value that is less than lookup_value is returned. If FALSE, VLOOKUP will find an exact match. If one is not found, the error value #N/A is returned(here 0 means false)\nnow why the range of values in which i am searching my value is written as\n$A$2:$A$6 not as A2:A6…there is a logic behind this also…if i write as A2:A6…there will be one problem….suppose it picks up the first value and searches for it in the first column….and the value is found at 4th place….(place here means 4th row…)…then when it will search 2nd value…it will start from 4th row only not 1st…thatz not wat i want….so with $A$2:$A$6 i have fixed the range that every values is to be looked in this range only ie. first row to last row of first column…\nhere is the screen shot of everything\nhope it makes using vlookup beautiful…\nthanks for your time\n….Sidhu\n","wordCount":"777","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2006-09-27T16:18:00+05:30","dateModified":"2006-09-27T16:18:00+05:30","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Amardeep Sidhu"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/blog/2006/09/small-things/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"amardeepsidhu.com","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://amardeepsidhu.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script><script data-goatcounter=https://amardeepsidhu.goatcounter.com/count async src=//gc.zgo.at/count.js></script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://amardeepsidhu.com/ accesskey=h title="amardeepsidhu.com (Alt + H)">amardeepsidhu.com</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)" aria-label="Toggle theme">
