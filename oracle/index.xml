      <title>Extended memory VM instances in OCI</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While provisioning compute instances in OCI, you may come across scenarios which need more memory and cores than what the standard shapes provide. Extended memory VMs are meant to solve that problem. Such VMs are able to access cores and memory across a single physical socket and it allows them to go beyond the limits of standard shapes. There are no additional charges for using this specific feature. Customer is charged on the basis of total number of cores and total amount of memory used.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week, got this issue reported by a DBA that he wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to su to oracle user from root on a Oracle Base Database VM in OCI. The login of opc user worked fine and he could do sudo su to root but he couldn&amp;rsquo;t su to oracle. When he did it just came back to root shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[root@xxx ~]# su - oracle
Last login: Fri Jan 12 10:20:38 UTC 2023
[root@xxx ~]#
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was nothing relevant in /var/log/messages or /var/log/secure. I tried it for some other user and it worked fine. Then I suspected something with the profile of oracle user and voila ! The .bashrc looked like this&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A customer is using an Exadata X8M-2 machine with multiple VMs (hence multiple clusters). I was working on adding a new storage cell to the configuration. After creating griddisks on the new cell and updating cellip.ora on all the VMs, I noticed that none of the clusters was able to see the new griddisks. I checked the usual suspects like if asm_diskstring was set properly, private network subnet mask on new cell was same as the old ones. All looked good. I started searching about the issue and stumbled upon some references mentioning &lt;a href=&#34;https://mudasirhakakblog.wordpress.com/2019/03/01/asm-scoped-security/&#34;&gt;ASM scoped security&lt;/a&gt;. I checked on one of the existing cells and that actually was the issue. The existing nodes had it enabled while the new one hadn&amp;rsquo;t. Running this command on an existing cell&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A customer who is using an Exadata X8M-2 with multiple VMs had Smokescreen deployed in their company recently and they reported an issue that one of the Smokescreen decoy servers in their DC was seeing traffic from one of the Exadata VMs on a certain port. That was rather confusing as that port was the database listener port on that VM and why would a VM with Oracle RAC deployed try to access any random IP on the listener port. Also it was happening only for this VM. Nothing for so many other VMs.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was working on configuring a new database for backup to ZDLRA and hit this issue while testing a controlfile backup via Enterprise Manager -&amp;gt; Schedule backup. It could happen in any environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Unable to connect to the database with SQLPlus, either because the database is down or due to an environment issue such as incorrectly specified...
If the database is up, check the database target monitoring properties and verify that the Oracle Home value is correct.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2nd line clearly tells the problem but since the Cluster Database status in EM was green, so it took me a while to figure it out. Issue turned out to be a missing / in the end of ORACLE_HOME specified in monitoring configuration of the cluster database. The DB home specified was /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.4/dbhome_1 instead of /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.4/dbhome_1 &lt;strong&gt;/&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was actually funny. So thought about posting it that sometimes how we can miss the absolute basics. This customer is using a virtualized Exadata with multiple VMs. One VM hosts the database meant to be used for dbfs and another VM connects to this DB over IB to mount dbfs file system using dbfs_client. One day VMs were rebooted and due to some reason the dbfs filesystem didn&amp;rsquo;t mount on startup. It went on for few days and they couldn&amp;rsquo;t mount it. One day I got a chance to look at it and the error they were facing was:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Database performance degradation due to multipath issues</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2021/03/22/database-performance-degradation-due-to-multipath-issues/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2021 12:54:19 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2021/03/22/database-performance-degradation-due-to-multipath-issues/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To put it in bit of an Indian context, database is not your daughter-in-law that you can blame it for every performance issue that occurs in the environment. But it does happen. Most of the time it is the database that is blamed for all such issues. Many times, the issues are in some other layer like OS, network or storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced this issue recently at one of the customer sites where performance in one of the databases went down suddenly. It was a 2 node RAC on 12.1.0.2 running on Linux 7 using some kind of Hitachi SSD storage array. There were no changes as per DBA, application, OS and storage teams. But something must have changed somewhere. Otherwise why would performance degrade just like that. I &amp;amp; my colleague checked some details and found that something happened in the morning a day before. Starting from that point in time, the execution time for all the commonly run queries shot up. Generally speaking, when all the queries are doing bad and you are sure that nothing has been changed on the database side, the reasons could be outside the database. But being a DBA, it is not easy to prove that. We took AWRs from good and bad times and the wait events section looked like this:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ZDLRA patching</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2021/03/12/zdlra-patching/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;To be honest, Fernando Simon has already documented all the steps needed in ZDLRA patching . So this post is more like a reference post for me and it points to the links on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.fernandosimon.com/blog/&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt;. One thing he could change though are the post titles. He also agrees ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/amardeep&#34;&gt;https://twitter.com/amardeep&lt;/a&gt;_sidhu/status/1370304085245661192&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZDLRA patching is broadly divided into two parts. First part is where you patch the RA library and Grid &amp;amp; DB homes. Second part includes compute node &amp;amp; storage cell image patch and patches for IB/RoCE switches. Second part is exactly similar to Exadata except that it is bit restricted in terms of image versions that you can use. Only the versions that are certified for ZDLRA can be used. Also the RA library version and the Exadata image version should be compatible with each other. So if you are planning to patch only one part; RA library or the image, make sure that both the components stay compatible. The MOS note that has all these details is 1927416.1. This note should be the first place to go when you are planning to patch a ZDLRA. The steps for upgrade/patch, image patching are given in MOS note 2028931.1. There is another note 2639262.1 that discusses some of the known issues that you may face while doing the patching. It is important to review all three notes before you plan to patch.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Faced this while running installer for setting up a 2 node RAC setup (version 19.8) on an Oracle SuperCluster. The error reported in the log is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;[FATAL] [INS-44000] Passwordless SSH connectivity is not setup from the local node node1 to the following nodes:
[node2]
[INS-06006] Passwordless SSH connectivity not set up between the following node(s): [node2]
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the error it appears that the ssh is not setup between two nodes but actually that is not the case. Here the error message is bit misleading. It turned out to be an issue with scp with openssh version 8.x. Running the setup with -debug option gives the clue:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Doing an Exadata mixed cells config with OEDA</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier versions of OEDA didn&amp;rsquo;t allow you to have mixed cells in the configuration i.e. High Capacity (HC) and Extreme Flash (EF). The way to deal with that configuration was that deploy the system with either HC or EF cells and then manually configure the remaining cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sure when did it change but the newer versions allow you have mixed type of cells in a single OEDA configuration. Once you select the hardware, there is an additional option called &lt;strong&gt;Enable Additional Storage&lt;/strong&gt;, where you can select the other type of cells. The minimum number of cells has to be three to use this option. Also the cells that are at the bottom of the rack physically should be selected as main storage and the other cells should be added as additional storage as that is how OEDA builds the configuration files.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Implementing ZDLRA – Part 2</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2020/10/06/implementing-zdlra-part-2/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 18:06:53 +0530</pubDate>
      <guid>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2020/10/06/implementing-zdlra-part-2/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/website-static/blog/2020/09/09/implementing-zdlra-part-1/&#34;&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed few things that you should take care before implementation of a ZDLRA. In this post, we will discuss few more things that you should review before or at the time of implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are getting two ZDLRAs (one each for primary and standby sites), there are two ways they can be deployed. One scenario is where all the primary databases (or the database that have no standby) backup to RA at the primary site and then the data is replicated from primary RA to RA at the standby site. This works well for the DBs that have no standby database. For the DBs where there is a standby database, there is a better architecture that can be deployed. In that scenario, primary databases backup to primary RA and the standby databases backup to standby RA. That saves you all the traffic over replication network. Oracle has published a whitepaper on how to do this configuration. Few of the instructions in this paper are a bit dated but it gives a good overall idea of how to do the implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep an eye on the features supported for different DB versions. An interesting one is that real-time redo shipping from standby databases is supported on 12c+ databases only. It is not supported for 11g. There could be other similar things. MOS note 1995866.1 has these details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Depending upon the ZDLRA software version being deployed, it may need a minimum version of EM and the ZDLRA plugin. MOS note 2542836.1 has these details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure after discovering the the primary and standby databases in EM, their primary-standby relationship is reflected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Real-time redo sent to ZDLRA is compressed but the archive logs backup will be compressed only if you use compression in the RMAN command. It is always good to include backup archivelog command with daily incremental job to make sure that no archive log is missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many of the environments have separate networks for backup traffic. Make sure the backup traffic to ZDLRA uses DB server&amp;rsquo;s backup network. If that is not the case, you may need to add an explicit route on DB server for ZDLRA client/VIP/scan IPs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are going to be different users that you will need to use: one OS user for deploying the EM agent, one DB user that will be used to run the backups. Depending upon your environment, it may oracle OS user, SYS DB user or could be some other named user created for this purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In next few posts, we will discuss some of the issues I have faced while doing ZDLRA implementation for some customers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quick note about an error I faced while running root.sh on an Exadata machine. The configuration tools failed with the following error:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;I did nslookup on the scan name and it all seemed good. So why the error ? After spending another 5 minutes, I looked at /etc/hosts and there was it. Someone had populated /etc/hosts of DB nodes with all the hostnames entries including the scan name. Something like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (ZDLRA) is Oracle&amp;rsquo;s solution for database backups. It has many advantages over other backup solutions that are available in the market. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blogs.oracle.com/frankwickham/zero-data-loss-recovery-appliance-zdlra&#34;&gt;This post&lt;/a&gt; has a brief introduction to ZDLRA and few links for further reading. This is a quick post about few of things that you should keep in mind if you are planning to get a ZDLRA (RA in short). Of course, there is a lot more that is needed while executing the whole plan, but these are some of the basics:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Exadata storage software version 20.1 introduces a new feature called &amp;ldquo;Secure Fabric&amp;rdquo; for KVM based multi cluster deployments (Exadata X8M). It enables network isolation between multiple tenants (i.e. KVM VMs based RAC clusters). This feature aligns with Infiniband Partitioning on OVM based systems. There are customers who in such scenarios want that VMs of one RAC shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to see traffic of the other RAC VMs. This feature achieves that. Similar to Pkeys in IB switches, here it uses a double VLAN tagging system where the first tag identiefies the network partition and the second tag is used to denote membership level of the VM. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/en/engineered-systems/exadata-database-machine/dbmin/exadata-network-requirements.html#GUID-75CC8740-CC7F-4A7B-B69B-B93E927E80EC&#34;&gt;Exadata documention&lt;/a&gt; has more details.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exadata Virtualized DB node restore</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are two common scenarios when we may need this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An existing DB node has crashed and is unrecoverable (due to some failure and non-availability of any backups. Though some of the things may need to be done even if the backups were available).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have an existing Exadata rack that is virtualized. Now there is a new DB node and the existing clusters need to be extended to include the VMs on this new node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently faced the first scenario where a virtualized DB node crashed and wasn&amp;rsquo;t recoverable. A bare metal DB node restore is a relatively simple procedure where we just have to reimage the node, create the needed directories, users etc and add it to the RAC cluster. In case of virtualization, the creation of VMs is an additional step that needs to be done. That makes it slightly more complex.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was not much that I could do so just waited. Also created an SR with Oracle Support and they also suggested to wait. It started moving after some time and completed successfully. Finally when the node came up, i checked that there was an NFS mount entry in /etc/rc.local and that was what created the problem. For the second node, we commented this out and it was all smooth. Important to comment out all NFS entries during patching to avoid all such issues. I had commented the ones in /etc/fstab but the one in rc.local was an unexpected one.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was installing Database Firewall version 12.2.0.11.0 on a Dell x86 machine (with 5 * 500 GB local HDDs configured in RAID 10) and it got successfully installed. Later on, I came to know that this version &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E69292_01/doc.122/e41705/host_con.htm#SIGAD40830&#34;&gt;doesn&amp;rsquo;t support&lt;/a&gt; host monitor functionality on Windows hosts. The latest version that supports that is 12.2.0.10.0. So that was the time to download and install 12.2.0.10.0. The installation started fine but it failed with an error:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Use of Exadata storage cells seems to be a very poorly understood concept. A lot of people have confusions about how exactly ASM makes uses of disks from storage cells. Many folks assume there is some sort of RAID configured in the storage layer whereas there is nothing like that. I will try to explain some of the concepts in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take an example of an Exadata quarter rack that has 2 db and 3 storage nodes (node means a server here). Few things to note:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It is actually a dumb one. I was disabling triggers in a schema and ran this SQL to generate the disable statements. (Example from &lt;a href=&#34;http://plsql-tutorial.com/plsql-triggers.htm&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;HR@test&amp;gt; select &amp;#39;alter trigger &amp;#39;||trigger_name|| &amp;#39; disable;&amp;#39; from user_triggers where table_name=&amp;#39;PRODUCT&amp;#39;;

&amp;#39;ALTERTRIGGER&amp;#39;||TRIGGER_NAME||&amp;#39;DISABLE;&amp;#39;
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
alter trigger PRICE_HISTORY_TRIGGERv1 disable;

HR@test&amp;gt; alter trigger PRICE_HISTORY_TRIGGERv1 disable;
alter trigger PRICE_HISTORY_TRIGGERv1 disable
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-04080: trigger &amp;#39;PRICE_HISTORY_TRIGGERV1&amp;#39; does not exist

HR@test&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;WTF ? It is there but the disable didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I was in hurry, tried to connect through SQL developer and disable and it worked ! Double WTF ! Then i spotted the problem. Someone created it with one letter in the name in small. So to make it work, we need to use double quotes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was another issue that I faced while trying to configure GoldenGate in HA mode. ggsci was working fine after normal installation but after configuring it in HA mode and trying to run ggsci, it resulted in this:&lt;/p&gt;

This is simply a shell script which in turn calls $CRS_HOME/bin/clsecho.bin . In the script, it sets various environment variables and that is where the problem was.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It started with an xls sheet (that was called dbm configurator) . Then OEDA (Oracle Exadata Deployment Assistant) was introduced that was a Java based GUI tool to enter all the information needed to configure an Exadata machine. Now with the latest patch released in Oct, OEDA has changed again; to become a web based tool. It is deployed on WebLogic and comes with some new features as well. SuperCluster deployments will continue to use the Java based OEDA tool.  The new interface has support for Exadata, ZDLRA and ExaCC. It is backward compatible and can import the XMLs generated by older versions of OEDA. Some of the new features include the ability to configure single instance homes, create more than 2 diskgroups, create more than 1 database homes and databases, allow ILOMs to have a different subnet etc.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;[sql]TNS-12543: TNS:destination host unreachable[/sql]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am able to ssh standby from primary, can ping as well but tnsping doesn&amp;rsquo;t work.  From the error description we can figure out that something is blocking the access. In this case it was iptables that was enabled on the standby server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Long story short, faced this issue while running OneCommand for one Exadata system. The root.sh step (Initialize Cluster Software) was failing with the following error on the screen&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hit this silly issue while doing an Exadata deployment for a customer. Step 1 was giving the following error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ERROR: 192.168.99.102 configured on dm01celadm01.example.com as dm01dbadm02 does not match expected value dm01dbadm02.example.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to make sense of it for quite some time until a colleague pointed out that the reverse lookup entries should be done for FQDN only. As it is clear in the above message reverse lookup of the IP 192.168.99.102 returns dm01dbadm02 instead of dm01dbadm02.example.com. Fixing this in DNS resolved the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a stupid error. Posting it so that someone else googling for the same thing can get a clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ASM instance running with default parameters (no pfile, no spfile). Updated spfile for the instance with asmcmd spset command and bounced crs. After reboot also, it still wasn&amp;rsquo;t using spfile. Got puzzled and checked GPnP settings again. All looked good. Then in alert log came across this&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So this customer has an Exadata quarter rack and they have an IB listener configured on both DB nodes (for DB connections from a multi-racked Exalogic system). We were adding a new DB node to this rack. So just followed the standard procedure of creating users, directories etc on the new node, setting up ssh equivalence and running addNode.sh. All went fine but root.sh failed. Little looking into the logs revealed that it failed while running &lt;strong&gt;srvctl start listener –n &amp;lt;node_name&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So if you are filling an &lt;strong&gt;OEDA&lt;/strong&gt; for Exadata deployment there are few things you should take care of. Most of the screens are self explanatory but there are some bits where one should focus little more. I am running the Aug version of it and the screenshots below are from that version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;strong&gt;Define customer networks&lt;/strong&gt; screen, the client network is the actual network where your data is going to flow. So typically it is going to be bonded (for high availability) and depending upon the network in your data center you have to select one out of 1/10 G copper and 10 G optical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Faced this error while querying v$asm_disk after adding new storage cell IPs to cellip.ora on DB nodes of an existing cluster on Exadata. Query ends with &lt;em&gt;ORA-03113 end-of-file on communication channel&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ORA-56841&lt;/em&gt; is reported in &lt;em&gt;$ORA_CRS_HOME/log/&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;/diskmon/diskmon.log&lt;/em&gt;. Reason in my case was that the new cell was using different subnet for IB. It was pingable from the db nodes but querying v$asm_disk wasn&amp;rsquo;t working. Changing the subnet for IB on new cell to the one on existing cells fixed the issue.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a T5 Super Cluster (running 11.2.0.3) I was creating a cascaded standby from an already functional standby using RMAN DUPLICATE and it errored out with&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ORA-01671: control file is a backup, cannot make a standby control file
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick search reveals that it is bug 11715084 that affects most of the 11.x versions except 11.2.0.4. There is a one off patch available for most of the versions or one can install the bundle patch that includes the fix for this patch. I applied BP26 and it worked fine after that.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This was my 6th year at Sangam and as always was good fun. We were a group of 4 people who were traveling from Delhi and we reached Hyderabad on Friday morning. Just wanted to keep a day for visiting &lt;a href=&#34;http://ramojifilmcity.com/&#34;&gt;Ramoji Film City&lt;/a&gt; and also wanted to avoid the rush that morning travel on the conference&amp;rsquo;s starting day brings. So after dropping the luggage at the hotel we hired a taxi and reached Ramoji Film City. It is a huge place and it is tiring to move around checking everything. But fortunately on that day the weather was very pleasant so moving around was good fun. We took a ride what they call as Space Walk and watched few sets where some movies were shot. Also they have a pretty good bird sanctuary over there where they have pretty good number of beautiful birds. Spending time there was nice and fun.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A rather not so great post about an ORA-00600 error i faced on a standby database. Environement was 11.2.0.3 on Sun Super Cluster machine. MRP process was hitting ORA-00600 while trying to apply a specific archive log.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The error message was something like this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;MRP0: Background Media Recovery terminated with error 600
Errors in file /u01/app/oracle/product/11.2.0.3/diag/diag/rdbms/xxxprd/xxxprd1/trace/xxxprd1_pr00_6342.trc:
ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: [2619], [539], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], []
Recovery interrupted!
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some googling and MOS searches revealed that the error was due to corrupted archive log file. Recopying the archive file from primary and restarting the recovery resolved the issue. The fist argument of the ORA-600 is actually the sequence no of the archive it is trying to apply.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many people have asked me this question that how they can learn Exadata ? It starts sounding even more difficult as a lot of people don’t have access to Exadata environments. So thought about writing a small post on the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It actually is not as difficult as it sounds. There are a lot of really good resources available from where you can learn about Exadata architecture and the things that work differently from any non-Exadata platform. You might be able to do lot more RnD if you have got access to an Exadata environment but don’t worry if you haven&amp;rsquo;t. Without that also there is a lot that you can explore. So here we go:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was troubleshooting some Windows hangs on my Desktop system running Windows 8 and enabled driver verifier. Today when I tried to start VirtualBox it failed with this error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Failed to load VMMR0.r0 (VERR_LDR_MISMATCH_NATIVE)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the online forums were asking to reinstall VirtualBox to fix the issue. But &lt;a href=&#34;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21654596/suddenly-getting-failed-to-load-vmmr0-r0-verr-ldr-mismatch-native-in-virtual&#34;&gt;one of the thread&lt;/a&gt; mentioned that it was being caused by Windows Driver Verifier. I disabled it, restarted Windows and VirtualBox worked like a charm. Didn&amp;rsquo;t have time to do more research as i quickly wanted to test something. May be we can skip some particular stuff from Driver Verifier and VirutalBox can then work.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was configuring EM 12c for a Sun Super Cluster system. There were a total of 4 LDOMs where I needed to deploy the agent (Setup –&amp;gt; Add targets –&amp;gt; Add targets manually). Out of these 4 everything went fine for 2 LDOMs but for the other two it failed with an error message. It didn’t give much details on the EM screen but rather gave a message to try to secure/start the agent manually. When I tried to do that manually the secure agent part worked fine but the start agent command failed with the following error message:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note about change in the way the compute nodes are patched starting from version 11.2.3.1.1. For earlier versions Oracle provided the minimal pack for patching the compute nodes. Starting with version 11.2.3.1.1 Oracle has discontinued the minimal pack and the updates to compute nodes are done via Unbreakable Linux Network (ULN).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now there are three ways to update the compute nodes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have internet access on the Compute nodes. In this case you can download patch &lt;strong&gt;13741363&lt;/strong&gt;, complete the one time setup and start the update.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There was an interesting issue at one of the customer sites. Few tables in the database were altered and the dependent objects became invalid. But the attempts to compile the objects using utlrp.sql or manually were failing. In all the cases it was giving the same error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SQL&amp;gt; alter function SCOTT.SOME_FUNCTION compile;
 alter function SCOTT.SOME_FUNCTION compile
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-00604: error occurred at recursive SQL level 1
ORA-01422: exact fetch returns more than requested number of rows
ORA-06512: at line 27

SQL&amp;gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;At first look it sounded like some issue with the dictionary as the error in case of every object (be it a view, function or package) was the same.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes you may need to run GoldenGate on some different machine than the one that hosts the database. It is very much possible but some kind of restrictions apply. First is that the Endian order of both the systems should be same and the second is the bit width has to be same. For example it is not possible to run GoldenGate on a 32 bit system to read from a database that runs on some 64 bit platform. Assuming that the environemnt satisfies the above two conditions; we can use the LOGSOURCE option of TRANSLOGOPTIONS to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just a quick note/post about the significance of COMPRESS and TCPBUFSIZE parameter in performance of a GoldenGate Extract Pump process. COMPRESS helps in compressing the outgoing blocks hence helping in better utilization of the bandwidth from source to target. GG is going to uncompress the blocks before writing them to the remote trail file on the target. Compression ratios of 4:1 or better can be achieved. Of course, use of COMPRESS may result in increased CPU usage on both the sides.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hybrid Columnar Compression (HCC) is a new awesome feature in Exadata that helps in saving a lot of storage space in your environment. &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/bi-foundation/ehcc-twp-131254.pdf&#34;&gt;This whitepaper&lt;/a&gt; on Oracle website explains this feature in detail. Also Uwe Hesse has an excellent &lt;em&gt;how to use all this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://uhesse.wordpress.com/2011/01/21/exadata-part-iii-compression/&#34;&gt;post on his blog&lt;/a&gt;. You can see the compression levels one can achive by making use of HCC. It is very simple to use feature but one needs to be aware of few things before using HCC extensively as otherwise all your storage calculations may go weird. Here are few of the things to keep in mind:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Well it was a simple schema to schema replication setup using GoldenGate. We were using the SCN method (Metalink Doc ID 1276058.1 &amp;amp; 1347191.1) to do the intial load so that there is no overlvapping of transactions and the replicat runs with minimum issues. Even after following this method, the replicat was hitting&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Came across this small oddity that documentation of 10.2 and 11.2 states that expdp by default takes consistent image of the database. But actually it is not so. You need to use flashback_scn/flashback_time for that. Metalink doc 377218.1 explains the scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been warning my customers about this for years. “Shut down all db access before taking a schema or full expdp!”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was a 10g (10.2.0.5 on HP-UX 11.23 RISC) database which was recently upgraded from 9.2.0.8. The CPU and memory utilization was going really high. After tuning few of the queries coming in top, CPU usage was coming within accetable limits but the memory usage was still high. There was a total of 16 GB of RAM on the server and the usage was above 90%, constantly. One of the reasons behind high usage was increase in the SGA size. It was increased from 2.5 GB (in 9i) to around 5 GB (in 10g). Another major chunk was being eaten by OS buffer cache. While looking at the memory usage with kmeminfo:[bash]Buffer cache        =  1048448    4.0g  25%  details with -bufcache[/bash]&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very simple issue but took some amount of time in troubleshooting so thought about posting it here. May be it proves to be useful for someone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scenario was: Oracle is installed from &amp;ldquo;oracle&amp;rdquo; user and all runs well. There is a new OS user &amp;ldquo;test1&amp;rdquo; that also needs to use sqlplus. So granted the necessary permissions on ORACLE_HOME to test1. Tried to connect sqlplus scott/tiger@DB and yes it works. But while trying sqlplus scott/tiger it throws:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I had a chance to upgrade a 9.2.0.7 database to 10.2.0.5. The size of the database was around 800 GB. The major applications connecting to the database were developed in Pro*C and Oracle Forms. The upgrade itself pretty smooth but there were few glitches around that needed to be handled. Just thought about documenting all the issues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Few users in the database were assigned the CREATE SESSION privilege through a password protected role (That role was the default role for that user). 10.2.0.5 onwards, password protected roles can’t be set as default roles. The alternate is to either disable the password for the role or assign CREATE SESSION directly to the user, not through a role.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Another let-us-help-Google post ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While running impdp import in 11g, you hit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[sql]ORA-39083: Object type INDEX failed to create with error:
ORA-14102: only one LOGGING or NOLOGGING clause may be specified[/sql]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is related to bug 9015411 where DBMS_METADATA.GET_DDL creates incorrect create index statement by dumping both LOGGING and NO LOGGING clauses. Due to this the CREATE INDEX statement, while running impdp fails with the above error. It applies to 11.2.0.1 (Metalink doc id 1066635.1)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been almost an year since i posted something (useful) here. The last post was also a crappy one :) . Well, it all boils down to sheer laziness ;) . Now, i think the time has come to be regular again. Here i am getting a good start talking about &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.aioug.org/sangam10.php&#34;&gt;Sangam10&lt;/a&gt;, i attended last week. It was a great opportunity to meet so many fellow Oracle professionals and most awesomely to meet &amp;amp; see &lt;a href=&#34;http://jonathanlewis.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Jonathan Lewis&lt;/a&gt; talk about Performance &amp;amp; Tuning. As expected the whole experience was amazing. It was a 2 day event where Jonathan was delivering 2 half day seminars on SQL Tuning and there were other break out sessions as well. We had planned to go a day in advance so me, &lt;a href=&#34;http://blog.aristadba.com/&#34;&gt;Aman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://ankitkgoel.wordpress.com/&#34;&gt;Ankit&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;http://neerajbhatia.wordpress.com&#34;&gt;Neeraj&lt;/a&gt; reached Hyderabad on 2nd Sep.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today one of my colleague was working on development of a screen in Oracle Forms to give the end user an option to schedule a job using dbms_scheduler. With the hope that i would be able to explain it properly, the whole scenario is like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User will log in to the application with his username (Lets say USER01) and password (basically every application user is a database user).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;He is provided with a screen where he can enter details about the job and the code behind the button calls a PL/SQL procedure in the main application schema (lets say APP1) which in turn uses DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB to schedule the new job.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The ultimate task of the job is to move data from one table in the first database to a table in the second database using a DB Link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a VPD policy applied on all the application users to restrict the view of data. Policy function uses SYS_CONTEXT to fetch some information about the logged in user. The main application user APP1 is exempted from policy and can see the whole data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things seem to work fine till the schedule part. But when the job runs it hits &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ORA-02070: database does not support operator SYS_CONTEXT in this context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; as SYS_CONTEXT and DB link doesn&amp;rsquo;t go together.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since long time i have almost been writing useless posts only. Now, i guess my blog doesn&amp;rsquo;t even look like an Oracle blog. So thought about posting something related to Oracle ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day before yesterday a colleague at my workplace asked that she was running an SQL script (which contained a simple DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH() statement to refresh an MVIEW), it ran successfully but after completion re-ran the last command run in the session. I was also puzzled and checked the SQL script but it contained simple DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH() statement. Next try revealed that the script actually had a / (slash) in the second line (with no semi-colon at the end of the first line). Something like this (I used dbms_stats instead of dbms_mview):&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Manually booting an OS from GRUB</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2008/12/14/manually-booting-an-os-from-grub/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my friend today asked me about removing Linux partitions &amp;amp; GRUB (from a dual boot system) and return back to windows alone. Removing Linux involves just formatting/removing the partitions. Now to remove GRUB either do &lt;strong&gt;fdisk /mbr&lt;/strong&gt; from a Windows 98 bootable CD or do &lt;strong&gt;fixmbr&lt;/strong&gt; after booting into repair mode with Windows XP CD. But if you have none then to remove GRUB you will need some utility like &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ambience.sk/fdisk-master-boot-record-windows-linux-lilo-fixmbr.php&#34;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; and if you reboot before doing that it might make GRUB unable to boot into Windows. It will get stuck at GRUB&amp;gt; prompt only. So there is an option: to manually boot the OS you want (ie Windows). A quick search gave link to &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ntcompatible.com/How_to_remove_GRUB_loader_t28242.html#150012&#34;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt;. It involves few commands on the GRUB prompt:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since long time i have been struggling to learn CSS and make &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amardeepsidhu.com&#34;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt; look great. The efforts did succeed but not in a way i wanted. After playing with CSS for few months i finally switched to Joomla and yes, in a week my website looks pretty cool. CSS automated ;) . Joomla installation is pretty next-next job. Then play around a bit and you are done. Next game is to choose a nice looking template according to your taste and addition of few extensions to make yours tasks easier. (Wordpress &amp;amp; Joomla rock because of these free extensions). So after long time i feel satisfied with the way my website looks. Here are the screenshots of the old and present new look for archives ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Few weeks back, in office we were looking at one procedure which was supposed to do a lot but if executed it finished in a sec (or less ;) ). I started looking into it and just opened the procedure and started scrolling to find that the last line of the very first cursor read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;where 1=2;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wonderful !&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so kids have stopped crying as they got some milk from their mommy: forums are better now (than when came back after an upgrade). There are reasons that it takes time for the things to be smooth. Fine. But what drives me mad is the way Oracle handled this and now ? The font size and those bloody bullets on left side which tell you if you have read the post before ? Please let me know if someone can interpret what those bullets tell and can read the forum without doing Ctrl + in Mozilla/Chrome and suffering from reading everything in large font size in IE 6 ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, as everybody has seen, last week they have again upgraded the OTN forums. And sadly it has been handled in a very poor manner. End result is that it is running terribly slow and throwing some errors many times. In my office, i cant even open it properly may be its too heavy or some issue with the internet. Also there has been lots of hues and cries about the new point system and all. That in my opinion is fine except that speed at which forums are running should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My company uses Lotus Notes for email and Sametime connect as messenger for all the internal communication. Both are stupid applications and are a big resource hogs. Most of the systems are P IV with 512 MB RAM. You just run Lotus and Sametime 7 and it eats up everything. The system moves like a 386 based machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, i was looking for Lotus short cuts today and found that there is no short cut in Lotus for &lt;strong&gt;Send/Receive&lt;/strong&gt; mail.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was just wondering what kind of maintenance OTN forums are undergoing ? It is 2nd day today and still not available. I checked it yesterday morning and now today morning still under maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is another new design on the way ? ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What you say !&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just noticed that there is &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com/forums/ann.jspa?annID=808&#34;&gt;an announcement&lt;/a&gt; about the maintenance in Community Feedback forum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Due to maintenance, forums.oracle.com will be in read-only mode between 6pm PT, Aug. 8 and 6pm PT, Aug 10. Search will still be available during that time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week i had a chance to conduct my life&amp;rsquo;s first interview. The guy was a DBA with 2 years of experience and it was supposed to be a telephonic call. I checked out his CV and wrote down around 8 questions on a paper, just to make sure that i myself don&amp;rsquo;t get confused during the interview  ;) . So i called him in the evening and started with introduction and his present job profile. Then i started with the questions from the projects he had done. He was confident about the stuff he was handling and replied all the questions honestly, saying NO at points where he didn&amp;rsquo;t know or was not involved in something. One of such thing was testing the backups. He said there is no testing done as such.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know a bit about Apache HTTP server but faced one issue in office&amp;hellip;so thought about writing it here ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are having a 3 tier setup where Oracle Application Server 10g was there on AIX 5.3. It runs Apache HTTP server and we needed to access the files outside DocumentRoot. A bit of googling revealed that we could use &lt;a href=&#34;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_alias.html#alias&#34;&gt;Alias&lt;/a&gt; for that. Basically we need to add the following small piece of text to httpd.conf file:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Our application (3 tier, Front end Forms10g and back end 10gR2) provides user with a front end to refresh the mviews. That form has 2 columns showing mview name and the comment against it. Recently i saw that while opening this front end ORA-01403 NO DATA FOUND was being raised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I opened the fmb and found that it was populating comments from DBA_TAB_COMMENTS. In 10g the comments against mviews are stored in DBA_MVIEW_COMMENTS unlike till 9i where it was in ALL_TAB_COMMENTS. So there was a little modification required.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just had a glimpse. OTN forums has got a new look. A bunch of new features has also been added. Some of the new things i noticed are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That simple editor is now rich text editor. Also supports emoticons.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can add tags to a post and it displays the tag cloud (for all the posts) on right side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A post can be marked as a question and then there will be some points system based on answers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;That list of Top users doesn&amp;rsquo;t show those users n ACEs. It display a new list of people instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report Abuse button has been added (with each reply).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;May be there are some other changes too. That is what i noticed in the very first look.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Today I was checking OTN forums and came across &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=2578116&#34;&gt;a thread&lt;/a&gt;. OP&amp;rsquo;s concern was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the db i am supporting has about 3.3 Terabytes capacity and the application is using only 1 huge tablespace with one big file.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;the system is linux 4 , 32 bit.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;em&gt;oracle version is 10.2.0.4&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Is there a limit of space for a tablespace when you consider insert/delete/query performance?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Import and default values for columns</title>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2008/05/10/import-and-default-values-for-columns/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had got an export of a database and had to import it to a new database. The only difference was that in new database few of the large tables were partitioned. So instead of partitioning it after the import, i thought about pre-creating the tables (with partitioning) and then run import with ignore=Y . Everything went fine. But later on the front end application gave some error and we came to know that default values for columns in some tables were not set. I did some googling and didn&amp;rsquo;t find much. Then i &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com/forums/message.jspa?messageID=25113&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; the same to OTN forums and came to know that if the table pre-exists, import doesn&amp;rsquo;t take care of default values of columns. Metalink note &lt;a href=&#34;https://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/f?p=130:14:4379750739032245945::::p14_database_id,p14_docid,p14_show_header,p14_show_help,p14_black_frame,p14_font:NOT,224727.1,1,1,1,helvetica&#34;&gt;224727.1&lt;/a&gt; discusses this. So if you are pre-creating the tables and there are some default values for any columns, set it manually, don&amp;rsquo;t rely on import for this. Same is true for impdp as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was searching for an error message in metalink and it was giving strange messages. Then i came to know that the error message contained &amp;ldquo;%&amp;rdquo; character and metalink was not really happy searching for it. Rather it showed a confusing message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/website-static/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/noname.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img loading=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/website-static/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/noname.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you are used to work in Unix enviroment and then sometime, in between have to sit on Windows and tail -f alert_DB.log, its a real pain. There is a small bundle of utilities, called &lt;a href=&#34;http://unxutils.sourceforge.net/&#34;&gt;Unxutils&lt;/a&gt; which can make you feel at home in Windows too. These are the exe&amp;rsquo;s of all major commands in Unix like more, less, ls, grep etc&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it just download the zip file from the link above, extract it to some folder and add the path of exe&amp;rsquo;s to your Windows PATH. Restart your machine and you are done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The manual process is real cumbersome. Today I came across few plugins which help in almost automating the upgrade stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wordpress-automatic-upgrade/&#34;&gt;Wordpress Automatic upgrade:&lt;/a&gt; As per description this plugin first takes backup and then upgrades. I didn&amp;rsquo;t try this one, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.zirona.com/software/wordpress-instant-upgrade/&#34;&gt;Instant Upgrade:&lt;/a&gt; I upgraded one of my blog using this. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t take care of backup but otherwise the upgrade was super smooth. Just few clicks and you are done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just finished upgrading to Wordpress 2.5. Everything seems to be working fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another issue I just came to know that wherever i am using &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/website-static/blog/2008/03/03/syntax-highlighting-for-code-in-wordpress/&#34;&gt;syntaxhighlighter&lt;/a&gt; to format the code, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t display properly in Internet Explorer. May be something to do with the plugin. Will try to fix it. It works fine in Mozilla.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]Could not get database version from the Oracle Server component. The CEP file rdbmsup.sql does not provide the version directive&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I was running export of an Oracle 9.2.0.1 database. The export completed but with an ORA-600 error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EXP-00008: ORACLE error 600 encountered
ORA-00600: internal error code, arguments: [xsoptloc2], [4], [4], [0], [], [], [], []

ORA-06512: in line 1
EXP-00083: The previous problem occurred when calling SYS.DBMS_AW_EXP.schema_info_exp[/sourcecode]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I googled a bit and found that the problem is with applying some patchset. Then metalink confirmed the same. Somebody tried applying a patch to upgrade it to 9.2.0.5 but didn&amp;rsquo;t perform all the steps (missed post installation steps, to be precise). Metalink &lt;a href=&#34;https://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/f?p=130:14:3653505393918947609::::p14_database_id,p14_docid,p14_show_header,p14_show_help,p14_black_frame,p14_font:NOT,300849.1,1,1,1,helvetica&#34;&gt;Note 300849.1&lt;/a&gt; covers the issue and also gives the solution. In nutshell startup the database with &lt;strong&gt;startup migrate&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;run catpatch.sql&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was copying some data from a DVD and it stopped in between due to some error with some file. Then I was reminded of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ranvik.net/totalcopy/&#34;&gt;Total Copy&lt;/a&gt; (A small alternate utility to Windows copy) but even thats is not much stable and you have to right click &amp;amp; drag for copy/paste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I googled a bit and came across another small utility called &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.codesector.com/teracopy.php&#34;&gt;Tera Copy&lt;/a&gt;. Its just 1 MB download and replaces Windows copy/paste. It provides many options like skipping a file, resuming copy and some other stuff. A must have for all Windows users. There is a pro version too.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Download it from &lt;a href=&#34;http://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/syntaxhighlighter.zip&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upload to your blog&amp;rsquo;s plugins folder and extract it over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now (on Wordpress) go to Plugins page and activate the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To use it wrap your code like&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today one of my colleague was working on a simple PL/SQL procedure. Based on some logic it was returning count(*) from all_tab_columns for few tables. It gave count incorrectly for one table out of around fifty in total. He just hard coded the table name and ran it but again it showed count as zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then he took the code out of procedure and wrote it in DECLARE, BEGIN, END and after running it showed the correct count. But ran as database procedure it always shows incorrectly.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with regular expressions in PL/SQL a lot lately and the one tool that’s helped me more than any other is Regex Buddy (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.regexbuddy.com/&#34;&gt;http://www.regexbuddy.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;). Yeah, it’s not free, but it was the best $40 I’ve spent. There are free options, like regex coach and a few free online options, but the problem is you have to find one that matches the Oracle specific Posix ERE format. Regex buddy even has a drop-down for Oracle syntax (&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.regexbuddy.com/oracle.html&#34;&gt;http://www.regexbuddy.com/oracle.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt;). I have no affiliation with this tool whatsoever, just found it to be exceptionally useful.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ORA-03113 Refresh of a mview in Oracle 10g</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2008/01/03/ora-03113-refresh-of-a-mview-in-oracle-10g/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/website-static/oracle/2008/01/03/ora-03113-refresh-of-a-mview-in-oracle-10g/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;At my workplace we were facing a problem with refresh of a mview. Say it was created in schema of user1 but when I tried to refresh it from user2 it would give ORA-03113: end-of-file on communication channel. Then we raised a SR and have been following up with Oracle support for long but it was not getting anywhere. Yesterday that guy seemed to have reached some point. The mviews that we have created and are having problem with refresh are created on top of both local &amp;amp; remote objects and he said that up to 11gr2 there is no possibility of creating mviews on both local and remote objects. I did validate this thing. All the mviews failing to refresh are created on top of both local &amp;amp; remote objects. But again from the owner the refresh is fine but from another user it gives problem. By the way that guy hinted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://metalink.oracle.com/metalink/plsql/f?p=130:15:3284197721413823598::::p15_database_id,p15_docid,p15_show_header,p15_show_help,p15_black_frame,p15_font:BUG,4084125,1,1,1,helvetica&#34;&gt;bug 4084125&lt;/a&gt; and also suggested a work around. I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried that yet. Will try and update about the results.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended a training on AIX system administration from IBM (organized by company, obviously ;) It was a 7 days course covering all of the system administration stuff. There was a lot of new stuff to learn, LVM being the most number of times uttered word, once we did the chapter on LVM. It was a nice experience as a whole as for the first time I attended any training on Unix.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://tkyte.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Tom Kyte&lt;/a&gt; did &lt;a href=&#34;http://tkyte.blogspot.com/2007/10/new-policy-of-sorts.html&#34;&gt;a post&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://tkyte.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;his blog&lt;/a&gt; about posting of reviews of questions on &lt;a href=&#34;http://asktom.oracle.com/&#34;&gt;Asktom&lt;/a&gt;. In a nutshell the reviews not related to the original question will be ignored/deleted (not decided yet, as Tom said).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As other people said in the comments, personally I too like this idea very much. Earlier, many times, there were questions which started with someone asking about appropriate SGA size, then there were some other twists and discussions and then the thread ended in discussion about good or bad authors or something similar light years away from the original topic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I was following &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=571079&#34;&gt;a thread&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com&#34;&gt;Oracle Forums&lt;/a&gt;. Someone asked a question about UNDO tablespace wrt to a scenario. The question was:&lt;br&gt;
There is a database and its hot backup is taken on Friday. Now for Saturday, Sunday and Monday there are archive logs but no backups. Suppose the machine crashes on Monday. After we restore the database to Friday (from backup), recovery will happen. As UNDO tablespace is of Friday so it has no information related to transactions that happened on Saturday, Sunday and Monday. So in the end of recovery process when we need to rollback some transactions from where that required information will come ?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a new kid on the block, I think, my post will not fire any serious and &amp;ldquo;scary&amp;rdquo; discussion as it has happened many times in the past. Just writing my experience. Whenever I search something related to Oracle in Google there are few sites that are bound to come up in the very first results ( No surety about the relevance and completeness of the content, though). Today I was searching about scheduling new jobs in oracle and I was, sort of, surprised to see &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.google.co.in/search?hl=en&amp;amp;client=firefox-a&amp;amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;amp;hs=JQ1&amp;amp;q=oracle+new+job&amp;amp;btnG=Search&amp;amp;meta=&#34;&gt;the results&lt;/a&gt; [Though, I got from there, what I was looking for &amp;amp; I would like to say Thanks for that]. Many other times also, I have seen these websites pop up like anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

That article talks about a guy &lt;a href=&#34;http://virgil.gr/&#34;&gt;Virgil Griffith&lt;/a&gt; who wrote a piece of software to track IP addresses of the people, editing the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil_Griffith&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; content. Some really interesting things came up: Apple attacking Microsoft and then Microsoft taking revenge. Have a look at the full article. It makes an interesting read.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Few days back, I had to give Oracle DBA training to a group of about 20-25 semi-technical people (Semi-technical, because most of them were not really DBA kinda folks doing all the techie stuff with Oracle, but in-fact having learned some bits &amp;amp; bytes of Oracle sometime back and these days looking into application functionality from technical perspective). I, having just about 10 months of experience with DBA profile, had to cover, everything about Oracle starting from creating database and up to performance tuning :) Its really an interesting job if the audience is good. But not an easy game. You have to know everything and have to be ready to answer people&amp;rsquo;s queries (some stupid &amp;amp; dumb questions also :) I had to cover a total of about 350 slides in a day or less. So at times, really went fast and skipping some of things. It was a nice experience as a whole :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many times, we are required to restore a database from an export dmp file. Its a simple task but sometimes there are some issues left like invalid objects or some objects missing, in the newly created database. Following steps, followed in order can help in creating an error free database:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a blank database:The very first step is to create a blank database which is to be used as the target database. That can be done using Database Configuration Assistant. (In last step of the DBCA, change redo log file sizes to 500 MB each (or some appropriate values depdening upon the size of the databaes), as during import, lot of redo will be generated, so large redo size helps in that scenario)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The day when Oracle 11g was made available for download on OTN, there was sort of, flood of posts in the Oracle blogsphere. Here is a quick recap of few of the posts (Whatsoever I could find through &lt;a href=&#34;http://orana.info/&#34;&gt;OraNA&lt;/a&gt; and my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.netvibes.com/&#34;&gt;Netvibes&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://awads.net/wp/2007/08/09/download-oracle-database-11g-release-1-now/&#34;&gt;Eddie Awad about 11g&lt;/a&gt;, I think he was the first one to post&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then Doug Burns &lt;a href=&#34;http://oracledoug.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/1308-Does-Anyone-Know-When-11g-Will-Be-Released.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been installing Linux for last 6 years and for more than half the number of times, came across a message something like &amp;ldquo;This partitions is beyond the 1024 cylinder boundary and may not be bootable&amp;rdquo;. But never cared for it much and understood what exactly it meant to say ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I was reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/index.html&#34;&gt;System Admin guide to Linux&lt;/a&gt; by Lars Wirzenius (Thanks &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dizwell.com/prod/node/675&#34;&gt;Howard&lt;/a&gt; for the link :) From there I came to know what exactly that message meant. Quoting from the guide itself:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last to last week, we shifted to a new house. As there was no internet connection, so we were without any internet access for last 2 weeks. Today we got the new internet connection. Its a DSL one. And the guy who came to do the installation threw a little bit of technical jargon like rebooting the router and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels so good to be back in the world of www :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Many times you need to move datafiles from one location to another. The simplest approach for this is to take the tablespace offline, copy the datafiles to new location, rename the files with &lt;em&gt;alter database rename file&lt;/em&gt; (Except that you dont have to move the SYSTEM and UNDO tablespace, as you can&amp;rsquo;t take SYSTEM tablespace offline)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYS@orcl AS SYSDBA&amp;gt; alter tablespace system offline;
alter tablespace system offline
*
ERROR at line 1:
ORA-01541: system tablespace cannot be brought offline; shut down if necessary&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I came across a requirement where users needed to ftp files time and again. So ftp&amp;rsquo;ing again and again is not a very good option. I wrote a small batch file for the same. Just sharing the same over here. I created a folder ftp in C drive and a file get_file.bat
Contents of get_file.bat are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;set /p file_name=Enter the name of the file you want to ftp:
echo oracle&amp;gt;c:\ftp\param.cfg
echo oracle123&amp;raquo;c:\ftp\param.cfg
echo cd /home/oracle&amp;raquo;c:\ftp\param.cfg
echo lcd c:\ftp&amp;raquo;c:\ftp\param.cfg
bin
get %file_name%
ftp -s:param.cfg 127.0.0.1&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One may encounter this error while importing from a dmp file from older versions of Oracle. Genereally this error is caused by some statement like alter session set current_schema=scott; And the simple reason is that the user scott doesn&amp;rsquo;t exist. Yesterday I came across this error. And the reason was that user was not created. As in case of import we generally create tablespaces first (by creating the DDL using option show=Y) but creation of users is done by import itself. In older versions of Oracle, the temp tablespaces were no different from other tablespaces. But in newer versions temp tablespaces are different. So in dmp files from thoese older versions create user statements are written like create user t1 identified by t1 default tablespace temp temporary tablespace temp. This thing worked fine in older versions but in newer versions we cannot specify the TEMP tablespace as the default tablespace for a user. So the statement create user t2 identified by t2 default tablespace temp temporary tablespace temp throws ORA-12910: cannot specify temporary tablespace as default tablespace. In such cases the users (for which default statement is specified as TEMP) have to be created manually by specifying the appropriate tablespace as default tablespace and then the import should be run with ignore=Y.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I switched to this new job, my profile has changed. Here I work as a DBA. So my interaction with Oracle &amp;amp; anything related to Oracle has also increased. Started exploring Oracle related forums and websites specially OTN forums (&lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com&#34;&gt;http://forums.oracle.com&lt;/a&gt;) This is the only page thats almost always open on my Desktop in office &amp;amp; Laptop at home and I refresh more than my office Lotus Notes. Today I was reading &lt;a href=&#34;http://radiofreetooting.blogspot.com/2007/07/where-does-he-find-time.html&#34;&gt;APCs blog&lt;/a&gt; , that Jonathan Lewis has also started posting on OTN forums and being so busy man, from where he finds the time ? I too think the same. There are so many people having many years of experience in industry, answering the questions on OTN, uesnet groups and various other forums and everything is for free. They are not paid anything for the same thing. Its like taking time out of your time, understand somebody&amp;rsquo;s problem, create same scenario your PC, try out and then post the answer ! I am, sort of new to the forums and sometimes for whole of week, I am unable to post any answers, even knowing something about the issue someone has posted. Just the &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; thing. These days I am very close to OTN forums, visit for whole of the day and also post answers to the questions I know something about. There are many people who are regular visitors and are answering questions on the daily basis. Hats off ! to all these &amp;ldquo;big bosses&amp;rdquo; of the technology !&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On OTN someone asked &lt;a href=&#34;http://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=523835&amp;amp;tstart=50&#34;&gt;a question&lt;/a&gt; that how to spool data from a table into a xls file. Spooling a single table I discussed in one of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/website-static/blog/2007/06/16/spool-to-a-xls-excel-file&#34;&gt;previous posts&lt;/a&gt;. We can use the same approach to spool data from more than 1 table also. Well here I will do it through a shell script and assume that you have a text file having list of tables to be spooled (Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t have one, it can be easily made by spooling the names of tables into a simple text file) Here is the shell script that you can use to spool data to various xls files, table wise.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;[sourcecode language=&amp;lsquo;css&amp;rsquo;]set feed off markup html on
spool onspool c:\salgrade.xls
select * from salgrade;
spool offset markup html off
spool off[/sourcecode]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the xls it makes shows up like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi Amardeep,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Am a newbie for Oracle and was searching for Howard Rogers articles. I found your post but It doesn’t have his articles anymore, When i click the link. It will be great if you can send me if the correct link or where can i find them or mail me if you have any.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, a simple method to import(export) directly to(from) compressed files using pipes. Its for Unix based systems only, as I am not aware of any pipe type functionality in Windows. The biggest advantage is that you can save lots of space as uncompressing a file makes it almost 5 times or more. (Suppose you are uncompressing a file of 20 GB, it will make 100 GB) As a newbie I faced this problem, so thought about writing a post.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The very first question that may come to your mind is: what the heck this &amp;ldquo;OC&amp;rdquo; is ? Well if PC stands for Personal Computer then OC stands for Office Computer ;) The story behind all this is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my friend (He is working in a non-IT company) called me and asked how to burn a PC so that it no more works :) Why ? because the PC they are given is too slow &amp;amp; old and thats the only way they can get a new one. I thought for a while and 1 or 2 ideas came to my mind. But to dig into little more details I called my friend &lt;a href=&#34;http://rollercoasters-bunker.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Vaibhav&lt;/a&gt; ( The guy I call to &amp;ldquo;discuss&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;know more about&amp;rdquo; all the techie things) He gave some really nice ideas. Combining all the thoughts, here is the summary of all the methods that you can use ;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, while installing Linux, installing LILO/GRUB to MBR makes you run into loads of issues, one of the most popular being that after reboot you are not able to boot into either of the OS ;) There is a way to use NTLDR to boot Linux, this way the MBR remains untouched and if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to see the Linux option, what you need to do is, edit your boot.ini and your are done.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Found a very interesting article on Dizwell&amp;rsquo;s blog. It was about keeping history of the SQL commands in SQL Plus on Linux. It is almost very simple. Just need to download a small utility called rlwrap from &lt;a href=&#34;http://utopia.knoware.nl/%7Ehlub/rlwrap/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Its a tar.gz file. Download it, un-tar using&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, here I am listing down the important tools and utilities I seem to use on the daily basis and without them life on internet &amp;amp; laptop really seems to be stuck, sort of :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Winamp: No need to say anything. Winamp is possibly the best and lightest mp3 (these days videos also) player. Just run Winamp in the system tray and enjoy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Winrar: Utility to uncompress compressed files. Earlier winzip was my favorite but recently I swichted to Winrar as Winzip doesn&amp;rsquo;t support rar format. I am pretty happy using it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was going through &lt;a href=&#34;http://awads.net/wp/&#34;&gt;Eddie Awad&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. There was one post about an article about NO_DATA_FOUND exception in Oracle. Both the posts you can find &lt;a href=&#34;http://awads.net/wp/2007/04/10/no_data_found-gotcha/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.ittoolbox.com/oracle/guide/archives/minitip-9-no-data-found-bug-or-feature-15602&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Do read. It is really interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are times when you just can&amp;rsquo;t do anything, I repeat, you just can&amp;rsquo;t do anything. In the evening I was working on my laptop and everything was fine. Next day in the morning when I got up, switched on the laptop and clicked on IE icon, it happily gave a beautiful error message &amp;ldquo;This application failed to start because msvcrl.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix the problem.&amp;rdquo; So it was the time for Googling about the error. Thank God I had Opera installed. After 2-3 hits I came to know that it was a trojan. Finally, there was one dll which needed to be deleted to get rid of this error message :) But after that there was some problem with IE in opening some of the sites. One option was to upgrade to IE 7 but don&amp;rsquo;t know why, I havn&amp;rsquo;t started liking IE 7 yet. So no other option left than restoring windows (I have Windows XP Media Center Edition installed).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I got my Laptop, along with it also got Norton Internet Security and 2 months subscription for updates &amp;amp; all. Whenever I would boot up the laptop Internet Security would open the window for configuration. I kept on cancelling it for 2 weeks or so. But one fine (read not fine :( day I configured it. It was very happy. Said &lt;strong&gt;Thank You&lt;/strong&gt; at the end. But the best was yet to come. After 10-15 days Windows (XP media center is installed on my Laptop) started showing signs of strain ;) It won&amp;rsquo;t start properly, after saying loading your settings it will stuck. Then I had to kill explorer.exe and start it again. With this also one strange problem that no startup items will be loaded :( I was discussing the same with one of my friend. He said that Norton must be the culprit. So I thought about uninstalling it. When I tried to uninstall it gave some strange error. Anyways it also told about one URL from where one could check details of the error. Finally when the uninstall started it gave one beautiful message &amp;ldquo;You still have 39 days of subscription left, if you uninstall the product you will not be able to reuse the subscription&amp;rdquo; :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was checking &lt;a href=&#34;http://tkyte.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Tom Kyte&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;. It was about an &lt;a href=&#34;http://nomadishere.com/2007/03/12/a-note-to-employers-8-things-intelligent-people-geeks-and-nerds-need-to-work-happy&#34;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; titled A Note To Employers: 8 Things Intelligent People, Geeks and Nerds Need To Work Happily. Well first of all meaning of all three words from &amp;ldquo;define: * in Google&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Intelligent: having the capacity for thought and reason especially to a high degree&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Geek: In computers and the Internet, a geekis a person who is inordinately dedicated to and involved with the technologyto the point of sometimes not appearing to be like the rest of us (non-geeks).Being a geek also implies a capability with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Running Linux from right inside Windows, just like a normal application !!! Idea looks cool. I was also searching for the same thing. After little bit of Googling got one link &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/beginners-guide-run-linux-like-any-other-program-in-windows.html&#34;&gt;http://www.lifehack.org/articles/technology/beginners-guide-run-linux-like-any-other-program-in-windows.html&lt;/a&gt; This article explains everything about making it possible. (Thanks Kyle Pott :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For the last 4-5 months I was almost without a PC and internet. This problem was solved when I got my HP laptop last month and then internet connection this month. One thing I had heard much about was RSS feeds and also wanted to try the same because there were many blogs which I used to check regularly. I had an idea about the concept used by RSS feeds that you will need to install a piece of software on your PC, give link of the page you want it to monitor and it will inform you when there is something new since your last visit.(period) Nothing more I knew.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;sometimes even very small things mess up everything in your head&amp;hellip;something similar happened with me also&amp;hellip;had two lists of numbers&amp;hellip;some numbers were missing in one&amp;hellip;wanted to find out thoes..instead of inserting values in tables then using SQL or using diff on Unix&amp;hellip;thought about using Excel for the same&amp;hellip;much heard about function VLOOKUP is there&amp;hellip;which we can use for such scenarios&amp;hellip;so I also tried the same&amp;hellip;.had heard a lot abt vlookup but was generally heard of it&amp;hellip;as when people used to write &amp;ldquo;=vlookup(bla bla bla bla&amp;hellip;)&amp;rdquo;&amp;hellip;i just used to count my heartbeat&amp;hellip;and look around&amp;hellip;so this was the time when i really needed to learn vlookup so as a normal computer geek wud do&amp;hellip;i opened google.com and started searching the same&amp;hellip;what i got was really disappointing&amp;hellip;.everywhere i almost found the same language&amp;hellip;.(oops&amp;hellip;.i also checked microsoft help even dat techie lingo didnt help as when you have messed up the things&amp;hellip;nothing really gets into your head&amp;hellip;.)&amp;hellip;some of that text&amp;hellip;m pasting here with a hope that it wont create copyright issues&amp;hellip;.i really got nothing out of this&amp;hellip;.&lt;br&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Searches for a value in the leftmost column of a table, and then returns a value in the same row from a column you specify in the table. Use VLOOKUP instead of HLOOKUP when your comparison values are located in a column to the left of the data you want to find.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
